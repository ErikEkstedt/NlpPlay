Pretty much nothing in that movie made sense That actually was one of the parts I liked 	 Did n't Wilson Phillips have a couple other songs that were popular

The Philedelphia Eagles the represent my hometown 	 I hear you I guess that is why I want Tampa Bucs to go all the wat this year

I remember forcing my parents take me to see that at an amusement park when I was 	 Oh my gosh I know what you are talking about I saw them that year too
Yeah the imagery is captured from whatever makes the best picture but think of how much of that is false You make sets you cast the people who look best to act out lives they never lived 	 Sure because it 's a story
Yeah I could see that 	 Well I guess I 'll see you at the show then
Pink Floyd for starters 	 Hm what about something with a more modern sound

I mean why else would you marry Kim 	 All about the infamy man
That scene was unbelievable 	 When that ball went through the table and Black Mamba had to lean back to avoid it I loved that

Animated movies are cute 	 Have you seen all the saw movies
Yea without that the prince would not have found her 	 That is true And then the got married
I can see why football is simply in our blood as Americans 	 It sure is most people probably wish the season could go all year long
I feel like Millennials do n't really get it or care for it 	 Maybe it 's sort of become dated in the sense that lots of musical genres are funky now
It must be I usually only get that feeling when I 've been in a certain place listening to a specific song 	 Give me an example
sure does 	 gets you to pay attention to MORE games
As in the NFL 	 Yea the NFL
To be honest I had low expectations for the film because I thought it would be those cheesy historical-like films But it was very surprising the got me on the edge of my seat many times 	 Really What is it really about
If they do win tonight do you think the Rockets will win the series 	 No IO think San Antonio will win the final game

Trace Adkins sings it 	 I will have to check it out
How was it 	 It was a lot better than I expected Creed 's son played by Michael Jordan did a very good job acting
No I have n't have you 	 No but I want to go see it tonight
Ca n't believe that Rodgers only has one ring he 's been the the best player for the last five years at least 	 I have to agree put him on the Patriots and they win every year
I do n't really like female singers 	 Neither do I but she is really talented and writes her own songs
Oh wow that 's actually a pretty neat idea 	 Yeah at first I did n't like it but as it went on I was so glad that the professor chose to teach us about symbolism that we might miss
Green Day The creators of Boulevard of Broken Dreams 	 I remember listening to that years ago Time for a throwback today
It varied actually Scheduling was left up to the individual teams There were no official standings 	 Wow that is crazy
I would have to go with Crossroads 	 I used to listen to that song all the time
I think they will win games 	 You do n't think the will win half their games
Wow Sakamoto and David Bowie on the same film 's score must have been a gift for the ears 	 Unfortunately David Bowie was not involved in the soundtrack at all
Not much honestly but he did win like games with the browns THE BROWNS of all teams so who knows I think he can win us games 	 I think cj beatherd is gon na make some noise in training camp and win the job

Did you know that originally the movie was supposed to revolve around Nick Wilde 	 Instead of Judy
Yeah he has catchy songs 	 Interesting What other rappers do you like
Good plot line too 	 I think it 's Mel Gibson 's best work
Are you serious Did they watch them yet 	 We have only watched a few so far They keep wanting to rewatch the first one
I do n't think they get back Alex Smith is unspectacular and I ca n't see that defense being as good this season 	 The AFC North teams should be better I could see Baltimore and Cincinnati getting the Wild Card spots
It 's kind of like alternative rock rap 	 Is it any good
On my Ipod I listen to several artist like Selena Gomez Shawn Mendes and Justin Bieber 	 I have an Ipod too You can store lots of songs on it

I really like indie rock and hip hop What about you 	 I like a little bit of everything actually I like to keep things diverse

I would love to go with you 	 Lady Gaga is one of the best artist since Madonna
Yes that 's it 	 I liked the Ferrari in that one
Yeah what 's that actors name 	 Nick Frost I think
Oh tough question 	 Yeah sorry
I never told you but I had a secret crush on Jeanine the secretary Annie Potts was the actress 	 Ooh heh how about that scene where Egon is under her desk connecting the monitor I can see you 're a very haaaandy person
It 's on my playlist for sure 	 What about Buddy Guy
I believe it was 	 Oh wow I was just a kid and they are still famous Have you seen them live
Yes and it causes kidney failure 	 Wow I glad he is okay
Looks like you have your tail between your legs 	 Well the team is winning

Yeah it is free does not use the RED subscription of youtube 	 Good i do not like that idea part of why i do not use it often
Nope 	 it will be cool to have s number like that against the each matchups
Yes but believe me It is much better than it sounds 	 Who 's in it
like clothing White people wore back in the 19th century.With wide ruffles on their shirts and things 	 That 's just so weird Why would they think that 's cool
I love cats 	 Me too but I hate the musical
She flies the Millenium Falcon better than Han Solo does 	 Not really She only repaired something Han did n't know about

Monster yeah it really told a story 	 That movie really draws you in
Did you like Bona Fett in Empire 	 Yes That scene where they had all the bounty hunters lined up was very cool
Same with me Luke is really the pefect hero for children while Han is a hero for adults 	 This is why Star Wars is so popular because many different age ranges can relate
I guess TLC but they are minus one group member 	 Oh yeah the Left Eye She died years ago
Come to think of it I have n't seen him in much either 	 Maybe this is a turning point in his career
The bar is doing Star Wars trivia next week What do you think they 'll ask about 	 Did Han shoot first
Yea I do not know what they are doing 	 Me either but Cleveland better start taking advantage of their picks because they have a lot of them
Goldie Hawn of course Anyway after she is mean to this carpenter she falls overboard and ca n't remember who she is 	 That sounds funny Is Kurt Russell the carpenter
Was there anyone in it that I would know 	 John Hurt was the voice of the villain
Yea me too 	 Im going to look up to see when her next concert is
Why do you think that is true Music has been around for centuries 	 Well many of the rock bands of the 's 's learned from the blues and spun off from there Very influential
She actually could pull that hairstyle off Did you like Kurt Russell in it 	 Yes I realized that he has aged more than I realized though I bet he is in his 70s

I 'm no Cowboys fan but that guy looks good 	 I think Prescott could be a real diamond in the rough
I know Disney never fails to amaze me 	 They are so creative at Disney
He apparently has become really good friends with the guy he 's portraying 	 I 'm sure learning the guy 's story was very touching
He 's not in the first one He joined later in the series 	 Have you seen any of the others
I hope they do a good job on it because if not Marvel is going to be dominating the genre for the next few years 	 I agree with you but i am totally hype to see Jason Momoa play Aquaman
Oh wow A whole good hollywood cast then I must be really good 	 It is If you watch this two I just mentioned you also have to see Good Will Hunting it 's a classical
Love George Loved the Beatles 	 George was a great rock guitar player
Yes and he reunited with his father 	 Phillip Seymour Hoffman was the nurse in the movie right
Do you ever listen to Lady Gaga 	 She is one of the few newer singers I will listen to occasionally
No 	 They are one of my favorite teams
Yeah one of the best songs either way 	 I know Off topic but ever notice that song sounds like the plot of Harry Potter
On a scale of Maybe a 	 That seems a bit low
Tell me about it Games have started at AM on the west coast I 'm not waking up for that 	 It 's such a disadvantage for teams to have to travel to London anyway
Celtics are nowhere near as talented as the elite teams yet accomplished a lot 	 Of course though no respect is given Wait till we see who they draft
Oh I am sure there are places with refurbished jukeboxes and maybe some of the old things were kept to decorate 	 Got to go Talk to you later

At first the Europeans were made prisoners but were able to save some guards and get freedom 	 Did they kill the dragons
Without a doubt Happy Gilmore 	 I agree Adam Sandler was fantastic in the movie

Who do you think will have scored the most goals at the end of the playoffs 	 I do n't know
I heard he came out with some cell phone case 	 What does it do
I really like Thriller 	 I like the song too but I like the music video more
Hey did you hear about Chris Cornell 	 The lead singer of Soundgarden No why
We need Crosby and Malkin to really step up to win 	 Maybe he can score a hat trick like back in January Should be a good series
Probably drive you to rip up your book But hey you never know what works for one may be poisin to another 	 True let 's hope I make it out okay if I try your classical workout music
I liked the new version better 	 How so

depends 	 On what
So do you think Han shot first 	 Well what cut are we talking about Original or Lucas edited

Oh girl me either but if he were funny like the air marshall or if Wilson Phillips were part of it I probably could 	 Right The end there was great too where they all did the dance
What type of music do you prefer 	 I really like pop music
Oh yeah it 's definitely fondly and not so fondly remembered now 	 For the most part only well liked cult-films are remembered You never hear about the ones that did n't real badly and forgotten
Why does everyone rave about the Greatful Dead so much 	 I have no clue
I agree 	 Scoring points on the predators is no small feat
Yeah the Colts do also 	 Do you think the changes in game rules have made a difference at all
It was n't bad especially when De Niro starts speaking in tongues 	 I might watch it
Probably I Know What You Did Last Summer 	 Oh that 's because you are a Jennifer Love fan
Yeah Our home state 	 They moved to Georgia which is pretty cool too

Huh 	 Football
Yeah I thought it had a very warlike victorious sound 	 I honestly have n't heard any Eluveitie I did n't like though
As for me I do n't have a particular favorite 	 What are some of your favorites than
A true fan 	 Yep So are you He was here for us through all the phases of our lives
yes he is all of the cast are so young 	 if you watch the first one then the second all of the kids grew up on camera
What is the story about 	 Scientists soldiers and adventurers unite to explore a mythical uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean They find an uncharted island which turns out dangerous
I guess I need to look into him 	 You should He 's in the conversation but like with Brady now it was just a totally different time and game then

I 'm going to have to go home and watch that one now 	 Definitely Such a great film
Do you have any more recommendations 	 Try the old Megadeath
I did n't even know that she played Quidditch 	 Absolutely she did After Hogwarts she even went on to play Quidditch professionally
What elements in particular did you like about it 	 Well for one the fact that it 's a very self-contained story
I do that too I 'll start with one thing and end up in a completely different place 	 The video for back on the chain gang was from when MTV used to be a music video channel
My favorite would have to be Jonny Tsunami though 	 I completely forgot about that one
They were too generic and also it seemed like the movie was trying too hard to be Politically Correct 	 I did like seeing some background information on the character Rita Repulsa though
What are you planning for this weekend 	 Why do you ask
When did the song come out 	 The song was first released in on the Bang Pow Boom album

I would frighten my dogs if I did that 	 Good thing I do n't have pets They do n't have to hear it
Do you think the NFL should draft kids right out of high school 	 If they are good enough why not The only problem is no back up plan if the person gets injured
Yeah That 's it Rap music today just is n't as good as it was 	 Well now a days they just repeat certain words over and over again and put a beat behind it No real talent there
Pocahontas 	 I do n't think I 've ever seen Pocahontas What 's it about
Why not 	 If my dad and uncle are going sometimes they want to bring my grandpa with them
Have you seen Bridget Jones Baby 	 Yeah I watched it on Netflix
But did n't they already have a game scheduled on Sunday 	 Yep they ended up having a double header
The Giants the DC Redskins the Philly Eagles and another team people often think are the south the Dallas Cowboys 	 That 's a lot of star power Maybe you 're right that the East has the best teams
Come on 	 I have responsibilities
Man this new album sucks 	 What one
Yes I do want to go see it soon but I may have to rent it now instead 	 I know sometimes I get too busy as well
Isabelle would love that She 'll probably go as Belle her favorite because of the name 	 Oh there are so many more reasons to like Belle She 's my favorite
Post-punk took the attitude and ethos of punk and ditched the simplistic aesthetic 	 That kind of makes sense So like the Sex Pistols wrote a loud power chord-y punk album and then John Lydon formed Public Image Ltd which keeps some of the attitude but is way different
Robert Schwentke 	 What happens in the movie
They had some great musicians 	 Yes they really did
So I agree they were good No doubt But now 	 They got this Prescott guy from Mississippi State He was awesome for a rookie
True I think they have a few other key players out with injuries too 	 Yup Steven Matz and Seth Lugo should be back soon too
Like what 	 My favorite snapshot is when the camera slowly zooms out while Vernon and Petunia look up as Vernon 's sister floats away
Haha yeah I do miss frank gore This season will be interesting with hyde 	 Hyde gets hurt too much to be a contender sorry friend

It 's cool to see an actual CD and a jewel case again It 's been a long time 	 Yeah I still think CDs beat streaming audio
You could make an argument that Case Keenum might be the best Air Raid QB in the NFL right now honestly 	 And yeah Jared Goff 's hand size probably played a role in him fumbling the ball times at Cal but he did manage to cut that number down to in his last season
Anyway another WR for Panthers is kinda redundant at this time Between Olsen Benjamin and Ginn Jr they have over yards 	 How does that comp -LSB- are to other teams

Exactly and is n't that the core of acting 	 It really is If we can award someone for gaining or losing a lot of weight for a role then Serkis should surely get one for his performance

I just do n't like pop rap music 	 This is not like that at all

With Olympia Dukakis 	 Yes it was great
Kim Deal 	 Yes they had that great song Cannonball

Definitely a great family movie 	 Yes it has good lessons for the kids
It 's not for everybody haha But they also had really catchy tunes Sweet melodies 	 What songs are they known for

A classic for sure 	 Black and white another hit
Yeah that is a bit funny Who do you think is more lyrical 	 I would have to say Nas on that Ether joint

That 's easy Blackstreet Have you heard their song If You Love Me Magic 	 No that one must have got by me Name a female who went solo from a group

Yeah A Good Day to Die Hard was insanely awful 	 Live Free or Die Hard with Justin Long
So you obviously liked it a lot I 'm assuming 	 Yes You would never guess that robots could be so expressive and emotionally endearing as characters

What about you 	 I like Hulk the most
That was what was confusing The first ten results on the Google page all showed different results 	 Was it because of the difference in dollars and euros
Yeah that 's a classic for sure 	 Ok that sounds good But next week we 've got to go see something modern like Light 's Out
Yes that was a good one 	 Do they still not like each other
that 's how you see it but what you 'd call casual is well worth 	 nah it can be that expensive i would say
I will say that the special effects were pretty good It had some pretty funny spots in it too 	 Really I did n't really think it would be a comedy
Well they have a good QB Sam Bradford signed two new offensive lineman in the offseason and drafted a center from Ohio State in the 3rd round of college draft 	 So who do they play in their fist game
I do n't think abused is the right word 	 But you said they are hitting her in the face consonantly right
That 's why I was so happy when Disney bought the franchise I was also a little concerned but now I see that they are doing incredible things 	 Yes and as a spin off doing well I bet they 'll make more spin offs
I thought so too But what about Planes 	 I think those are considered as Spin Off since it has a different cast
Yeah I like the fighting scenes and how the characters get you into the plot 	 What do you think about the new Marvel movies

What 's the last good thriller movie you saw 	 I watched the movie Se7en recently
But it all came together on Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band that 's the one everyone looks to their breakthrough album 	 It 's still just a continuation of Revolver 's experimentation Listen for example to the reversed guitar on Tomorrow Never Knows

Never saw that one but I have definitely heard of it 	 It is a great one

They are alright 	 I like their mascot
Well like I said it is very early in her career and she is not all sexed up like she was in other films The theme is also dark about suicide and I think it might scare some people I also admit sometimes it borders on the melodramatic but I really love it I love seeing her playing a serious role like that 	 I can see some parellels between Nell 's character and Monroe 's own personal life ca n't you

Not into all that sci-fi I guess 	 No I think its become too computerized for me I much prefer the older ones
I thought the best was Hedwig The best part was when he was dancing to the Kanye West song in his room 	 That part was pretty funny James McAvoy was able to do a great job portraying each role he was really believable

I would agree with you there Heath Ledger 's performance was an all-timer 	 He was so creepy in it It 's a shame he never got back in time for another one

I know he 's such a powerful player 	 I wish I could slam dunk like him

Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace played their roles very well as usual 	 Yes they were in the one previous to it

The best part by far was when she went out into no man 's land 	 I though so too it just showed this epic fearlessness
I would say that rock would be my second favorite 	 That is probably my favorite What are some of your favorite bands
That sounds deep by the title alone 	 It is It 's over minutes long and the flow lyrics and beat are all very thoughtful
What types of movies do you like 	 I like all kinds really

Well I think the Patriots are the top of the list What about you 	 Ehhh I think that 's an easy pick but I 'm going with a darkhorse the Dolphins
What songs were in Crooklyn I do n't think I 've ever seen it 	 Pusherman by Curtis Mayfield Mighty Love by the Spinners Thin Line Between Love and Hate by the Persuaders Just fantastic

Same here Who do you think is going to be the best AFC team next season 	 I 'm not sure but I hope it 's the Titans
So you got the Penguins in the Stanley Cup Final 	 Oh yeah I really believe that it is their time

Yeah Eminem knew what to do 	 I have to give props to Dre as well
I do n't know but she looked like she was or so in the movie 	 What I mean is that it s only shocking because you 're used to seeing her with makeup which makes her look younger
I do like them I do not play them as much as her other tunes 	 I do n't either but they make for good background music if you are having people over for dinner
Those are really good 	 Yes they are i enjoyed all of them
But you like something about him specifically otherwise you would n't have delved into more of it right 	 I mean his voice does n't do anything for me

Do you remember the movie Ca n't Buy Me Love 	 The original

I 'm going to go buy it Do you want to come 	 Let 's go
I love the classic beauty and the beast 	 Me too
So they have an upbeat tempo 	 Yes very fun music
I did n't know that 	 Very few people do
It was fun but I got some motion sickness too 	 Did you think you needed a translator in many of the films

DO you know hollaback girl 	 Yes I know that one i use to play that one alot
Trina I remember the name but ca n't remember what song she sang 	 She had this big song about years ago called Here we Go

Yeah it 's too bad he was shot 	 I know I bet he would 've kept making good music
I like Cinderella the best 	 Cinderella 's friendly but she did n't really do anything
It does remind me of his artwork though 	 I liked the book a lot and Disney did a great adaptation of it for sure
I either love his stuff or I hate it and there 's no middle ground 	 It 's funny because I agree completely
I wonder if they will make a show 	 Based on what
A local guy just helped the Cubs break a long and painful curse 	 The GM of the Cubs also helped the Boston Red Sox beat their curse
Kinda 	 So you do like Lady Gaga then

Who sings I am the Walrus 	 That is The Beatles
oh I see there seems to be a lot of good action though 	 one of the best vfx I have ever seen
Yep and now the Celtics are paying for that again 	 Well at least it 's only points
I suppose so but the franchises just seem to keep making movies even after they stop being good 	 This last one was still pretty good
They really are I could n't believe Mr. Waternoose turned out to be on Randall 's side 	 I could n't believe that either Good thing he was captured and arrested in the end
Penny Lane 	 Great song
Wow I respect that 	 That 's amazing He was certainly motivated
They had so many I guess I would have to say Love Bites 	 What is your favorite album
Well they have DeGrom on the mound tonight maybe they can get a win 	 They desperately need it Right now they are games behind the Nationals
I do like that new Sound of the Times song 	 And why is that
Maybe this will be a case of good the nuns vs evi the posesses doll 	 Could be when is the release date

I 'm not a big fan of Caddyshack it has its moments but overall it 's disappointing to me 	 Really You do n't like Rodney Dangerfield and his one liners or Ted Knight 's stuffiness
Do you like Gwen Stefani 	 I think so is she a singer
What is it about pirates that people are so attracted to 	 I think part of it is the romantic lifestyle of always moving And the gold helps

That 's just such a nice story How long have you played the piano 	 Since I was twelve My mom randomly decided to buy a piano one day and I 've been playing ever since
It 's based on a story about a storm that causes sailors to be stuck in a sinking tanker 	 I 'm liking it already
That is tough I would go with strawberry fields forever 	 why that one
Well that was kind of fun Besides they just destroyed the evil empire 	 They also almost killed Luke Han and Chewie
The food is overpriced and they do n't let you bring in outside food or drink 	 When I was a kid my parents used to sneak in soda in their jackets
How about Pittsburgh making a run 	 They 're offense can be scary good
He is so fast He gets to all those balls that I do n't think he will He is really impressive 	 Gary Sanchez caught a heck of a game last night I thought the ball was going to go right past him
I really liked the storyline of how superheros were seen and how they lived 	 Do you think we will ever see a sequel
That long ago 	 Yes crazy We were just little kids back then
Same here It 's kind of unfortunate that it feels almost like it 's completely pointless and adds nothing to the Killing Joke story 	 I do n't think it does You can literally skip the entire thirty minutes and it feels like a whole separate movie
They are good but I thought Michael Keaton made a better Batman and Bruce Wayne 	 So is he your favorite Batman
I like the duet with brad paisley too 	 That is a good song and the video is cool too
I guess we will see 	 It is just really exciting to see them playing so well
I went to a couple of their concerts 	 Cool how were they
I was grabbing tissues every time one of the dog 's died 	 What was your favorite part
What one was it 	 It was called Giant
But none of the other main cast bothered to do any of those straight to release DVDs movies 	 They thought they could start a franchise like National Lampoon
Well she is also famous for doing covers and has done one of the Queen classic another one bites the dust 	 I think she has definently been influenced by them in the best way
How was the relationship between anakin and the princess 	 They were very cute together
I 've seen the first Star Wars movie as well but I have n't seen either of the latest two I want to though 	 Yeah you should Star Wars movies do n't typically disappoint

Yes He has my favorite songs like My Name is 	 Do you like that real slim shady song too
Oh that 's interesting I know a lot of Packers fans 	 Do n't introduce them to me
Yeah but he did n't have big part It was a good thriller movie 	 I remember there was a lot of suspense
Oh I forgot my favorite genre is shorts And wait for it Melissa Gilbert and her husband Tim Busfield made one of the shorts and they are going to be speaking after the presentation of it in person 	 Really I love Melissa Gilbert Alright can I come with you
What did you think of Gaga 's superbowl show 	 It was fun
I 'd say The Lonesome Crowded West and Good News for People Who Love Bad News Both of those will be more recognizable to you 	 Cool I 'll check them both out Text me and let me know when the show is
I really like both the lyrics and the sound It 's a really serious important subject but it 's done in such a fun happy upbeat way and it 's sarcastic too 	 I love sarcasm and how ska bands seem to love incorporating that into their songs
He is great in 	 Yea the movie was amazing
Very much so He did a song about years ago called Guitar that I could n't get enough of 	 Really
did n't you watch it already 	 i dont mind watching it again
Oh yeah that 's cool with the special effects being so modern at the time 	 What else
Yes it was so sweet 	 It was a great movie
The sixth one is a lot like that too 	 That was pretty smart of them to spin off the genre
Even when the plot is decent the actors are bad 	 I can agree a little sometimes the actors are not that great
Is there another movie like that you would recommend 	 Well have you seen Hush
Yes I am 	 What is your favorite team
I see That makes sense then 	 My favorite movie is probably Avengers though
She 's good too Were they ever a couple in the movies 	 I do n't eblieve they were but really did n't see them all or remember much
SO DO YOU WANT TO MEET IN THE MORNING 	 I THINK THE AFTER NOON WILL BE BETTER FOR ME
What team do you think will get better 	 The Timberwolves will hopefully get better
Atlantic Records released that album for him 	 I think that one was nominated for Grammy of the Year for that album
Yes but I 've heard that the ending might not have been so positive 	 Indeed the ending was totally up to personal interpretation That 's what was so beautiful about the movie
Oh boy that 's not a win 	 Then they have the lions eagles and bears
It 's true 	 I really feel like you ca n't really claim to be a music lover and then turn around and flat out dismiss an entire genre
He is an awesome actor 	 Those eyes of his are amazing Bluest I have ever seen
Yes I think she went on hiatus for awhile but eventually came back to record and release more music 	 I 'm actually starting to remember liking her voice a lot It was really soulful and different
It 's going to be a challenge for Jumanji to make an impact with Star Wars releasing 	 I know I will for a fact go watch the opening for Star Wars
Will their defense better 	 It is really a matter of just wait and see
When they first started singing they were in disguise yet there were still a lot of people standing around 	 Did the crowd know it was Jimmy and Miley at first
Yes To the untrained ear they sound very similar 	 What 's the difference then
In fact I liked it very much I would rate it in my top films of all time 	 Wow that 's saying a lot you 're a year old white male so i would n't think you 'd say that Clearly the majority of Lee 's fans are Black
I agree he is 	 Did they play Where The Streets Have No Name
They had a good draft this year 	 Yeah but it 's the Browns
She has an amazing voice What are your favorites on that record 	 White Christmas Orange Colored Sky and You and I are the best on it
I love his deep voice 	 Me too With A Little Help from My Friends is so memorable
The packers 	 Oh nice they did really good last year
What 's that 	 Her brain
Thats good me too i mainly listen to pop though 	 I like pop music
Really they scored runs in one inning 	 Yes it was exciting to see especially the Moustakas homerun
Ok Stop So Biochem girl Ok What do YOU want to watch 	 I do n't know I 'm conflicted It seems like she would feel uncomfortable with a romantic comedy It 's too early
I like to zone out and drive to that one 	 What do you think of imagine
Who was your favorite actor in it 	 I like James Earl Jones
I think I may have heard that one but I do n't really remember 	 That song is popular but I have other reasons for liking him
Me either I just kind of expect him to be here forever 	 Do you think the Patriots will make it to the superbowl again this year
What is a great thriller movie 	 North by Northwest
The Cowboys for sure 	 What The Cowboys You really think they have a chance
Me too 	 He is a great singer
I do n't know if I can get into the rap genre 	 It 's rap but he has some producers that have a more jazzy style
Do you have any favorite moments in the film 	 When Donald O'Connor sings Make 'Em Laugh It 's a great song for him he shows off his dancing he walks up walls it 's awesome
What did you like the most about it 	 I liked the Villain I thought he was so cool
No These films never review well 	 But people like them anyway I guess
The movie over all had a great message to stand up for others 	 I liked how Bridget stood up for the Trolls at the end
Exactly And Vader flies one and they seem so fragile They seem outmatched 	 Well the rebels were supposed to win
RB is a position that takes a lot of abuse 	 True Guys do n't last very long there and Bell has a history of injuries
Yea it can be brutal 	 The league has tried to do something
He did a fantastic job portraying Freddy 	 Hence giving you nightmares
As much as I hate to say it do n't sleep on the Giants 	 Why you say that
I agree completely It seems we kept going and out and giving the ball right back to the Patriots 	 Yeah you ca n't give Tom Brady the ball back He 'll make you pay
I am surprised they havent sold commercials yet 	 Why They pay a premium just to get viewers
Do you listen to Tech N9ne 	 Yeah I love Tech N9ne
I think he had a mini-series based on the character as well 	 Yes I think so too
Exactly So they reshot the end to make him more measured 	 Sounds like it was a smart move
Maybe that kind of humor is n't your thing 	 I guess not
Yea it will be we have Elloitt and an awesome quarter back 	 Well see i still think that greenbay will go all the way
How big was the theater 	 I do n't know it probably held people per theater
I remember a few years ago when that was popular 	 I used to have it on my mp3 player and would listen to it when I went walking
No I have n't heard of him is he any good 	 Yes he 's right up there with the greats
I can not remember the name of it but is the one about the father and the son 	 I can not remember the name of that song either now It is such a great song though
That had Jason Statham in it 	 I like him
It was n't too bad had a lot of action in it and some comedy as well 	 Cool I 'll have to look it up
Definitely But this could be a springboard for them They still have plenty of time in this season 	 True Reyes helped him out of a jam in the 7th inning
Yes good point Some like Julien Baker are really good but they mainly sing about love 	 The Fleet Foxes and Neutral Milk Hotel are very mystical but convey antiestablishment
Which one of her songs do you like the most 	 I love her older music way better than her new stuff
I enjoyed this also though I am much younger than you 	 Why do you have to remind me of this Princess Leia was my favorite
So what 's your team Are you still a 49ers fan 	 Oh hell no They lost me when Harbaugh left and Kaepernick was benched
Wan na go to the mall to buy more football gear and things 	 I 'm always down for new Packers gear
Do you know how long 	 I do believe Art Rooney purchased the Steelers franchise in
I do n't talk about him He 's a traitor 	 So you still think that they 're destined to win
My dad used to love them He went and seen them live when he was younger 	 That would have been an amazing opportunity I bet he had an awesome time
And I still hear people quoting some of the script 	 Oh how can you not
My Mom was asking me why I thought hewas doing so poorly this year I said I thought it was that he 's lost about mph off of all his pitches 	 Well that plus I think his arm slot is different it seems like his pitches do n't have much rotation
You think latin music is the best music 	 DESPACITOOOOO
Did it cost a lot to make 	 No it was extremely cheap and it made so much money
Yes dusty is the airplane 	 I hope the movie lasts longer than minutes this time

They were last place in their division last year 	 I know but they are better than that
What about the Sarlacc 	 They added a computer generated beak
OK let 's try another What do you think of Rihanna 	 Now you 're talking about a proper star
It was a tough match between Rhianna and Beyonce 	 As far as wearing red goes Lady Gaga takes the cake
I see them in the streets every once in a while 	 Did you know they only came in silver
I remember when the first one came out 	 Yeah what year was that
Me too 	 Is Tina Fey in it
they just keep fighting megatron who just does n't die 	 that does get annoying now that you mention it
This movie is a great tressure 	 Those ruby sleepers were to die for
I loved John Candy in that one 	 He is a half dog so funny when he gets the dog treats
Are you a fan of hip hop 	 I am but I do n't like the new stuff they 're playing on the radio
I 'd be a jedi 	 What do you think about the Star Wars Prequels
You had n't heard him before 	 No I had no idea who he was but he was really good Just see who is playing locally and take a chance
It does n't seem like the average listener should relate to the content most of them rap about making lots of money and driving fancy cars 	 Yeah rappers like Tupac and even others like Dr. Dre really rapped about stuff that told the listener what they experienced
How crazy is it that New Found Glory is still making music 	 It is not that crazy they are a good band
Woody was my favorite character what about yours 	 I really liked Buzz Lightyear
That class sounds crazy 	 It is We had to sing in front of the class and be told we 're wrong And it was for a grade
Which one do they have of KC and JoJo 	 All My Life
Guess you could n't really do that back then huh 	 Nope
It looks OK but I am super done with Spiderman 	 I agree with you I think I 'd like more movies about other people
Haha oh sorry to hear that Lol 	 Yeah I know its been rough but they are rebuilding
There are not any good ones 	 That could not be any further from the truth
I loved it 	 Was n't that werewolf cool
I know right 	 Now they want to charge for all them old flicks and stuff
Million Dollar Baby was so fun to watch 	 Yea but the ending was really sad
Yeah they did a really good job with that 	 But I heard he wore a cap for the movie
I do n't know if I have a favorite but I definitely have a few 	 So what are they
People in the states are becoming disinterested 	 The finals doesnt even draw a ton of fans
Wow that is a great one It 's really intense too 	 Yeah it is Do you remember the scene where he beats the two guards and escapes
Have you seen Trainwreck yet 	 No I have n't Have you
I love movies 	 Me too
Yes I heard that too I 'm not sure if she has announced the dates yet 	 Do you know the real name of the singer Lana Del Rey
What an odd evolution they evolved into males only so there 's no reproduction 	 Good thing Can you imagine them taking over the earth or procreating
Even that bum on Jacksonville 	 Who are you talking about Yeldon
No kidding Who could they beat 	 The Browns Maybe Perhaps the Bills on a really good day Otherwise I ca n't see a winnable game
Oh yes he is really funny His movies always make me laugh 	 There 's a new trailer out for an upcoming film he is doing with Pierce Brosnan
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE BAND DISTRUBED 	 YEAH ARE N'T THEY PRETTY HARD ROCK
She was so good 	 I know
Well the Titans are in Tennessee and that 's a college football state 	 Yes it is but in Florida you have The Gators Noles and the Canes
Well I do think John Lennon had the best solo career but the question of best solo Beatle album is different 	 Indeed My favorite is Ram by Paul McCartney
Yeah it just popped into my head But I was mulling over a question 	 What question
I would say Eh Eh -LRB- Nothing Else I Can Say -RRB- was my favorite All the songs are so catchy though it 's hard to choose 	 Oh man I totally agree Her early work was some of my favorite music
Did you like the Avengers 	 It was a great film
They sound like a band you could put on whatever your mood 	 My favorite Hawkwind album is called Warrior on the Edge of Time and it 's very sci-fi influenced lyrically
Matt Stafford is my favorite quarterback in the NFL he just knows how to win games 	 It 's been a long time since a Detroit Lions fan could say that about their quarterback Stafford definitely has been looking really good
I likeMaroon 	 I also think Adele has an amazing voice
That is what he is known for 	 That and his crazy hair
No I wish I might suggest it now 	 Hopefully they do it 's great
Dave Roberts and Don Mattingly were right in the middle of it 	 It 's always surprising to see managers in the middle of a scrum
Every time he got near the ball carrier I 'd be yelling Hang on to the BALL 	 He really was one of the all time greats in the league on and off the field too
Which was that 	 It was a Packers-Seahawks game played with the replacement refs
Example 	 Independence Day
So did I I never understood why so man people had a problem with that movie 	 Fan-nerds that was the problem They nit picked it into oblivion
I agree a little I guess I just hate the one and done guys 	 i do n't like it either I wish they would make a rule requiring players that go to college stay at least years
I agree I also think you can compare them to Third Eye Blind 	 Yes that is a good comparison
some spanish 	 me too
Awesome Check out The Resistance It 's one of the best songs on there 	 Okay awesome thanks Do they have any songs I may have heard of
This song is a jam it constantly gives me energy while this song is playing 	 That is excellent
I have n't seen it yet so do n't tell me anymore 	 Oh yeah I 've become one of those people who avoids watching film trailers
I guess next time we should have a conversation about country music 	 I 'd be a lot better informed about it
Smokey and The Bandit Smokey and the Bandit and Pitch Perfect 	 I love Burt Reynolds Smokey and the Bandit was hilarious
Well yeah that 's why I do fantasy 	 So you can watch other players right

My favorites been Abbey Road but Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is awesome too 	 I did grab Abbey Road already I look for the other

I hate the whole thing in that scene in the bar 	 What thing
Okay You 're either seriously mistaken or hopelessly brain-damaged I do n't want to talk to you any more 	 The best part though the very best part is when the English guy insults them for their bad singing

Who is in it 	 Oh it has that guy from Black Mirror the creepy future episode
Me too 	 I liked the plot of the movie
Somebody has got to lose Fisher is pitching for the rocks 	 Who 's pitching for the d back

I love candle in the wind 	 Yea it 's about Princess Diane
The reason I like Unforgiven is just how non-Hollywood it is 	 You mean how Clint Eastwood is an anti-hero
Well Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter both are obviously 	 Who do they play
It 's rare that a sequel is better than the original Can you name another example 	 Addams Family Values is better that The Addams Family

Can you believe Prodigy died 	 Who

He 's really good 	 Too bad they had to kill him off in the first one
Man they are such a mess All those number picks and really not much too show 	 It 's hard to comprehend since the NFL has a salary cap that they ca n't put a better product on the field
Do you have any other zombie movies you like 	 World war Z Night of the living dead days days later
You realize the external shots of the building ca n't possibly align with the interior shots Nothing is what it seems 	 So why is n't it just bad film making
They were fast 	 They were frustrating
yeah the british band from the 's 	 the singer used to be a celeb crush for me
I saw Revenant with Leonardo Di Caprio last week 	 Oh man I love that movie
I thought that part was a little bit cheesy to be honest 	 I think all of the movies have been a little bit cheesy but they 're true to the books for the most part which is what matters
Me too That was one of those that stuck with me even as I was trying to fall asleep 	 I like the older scary movies almost more than the current ones For instance Poltergeist is one of my all time favorites I can watch it again and again
Some team will shine like Denver did with that defense a couple of years ago 	 I 'm an AFC fan and do n't follow the NFC much Who 's rising there

Keep asking questions to try and guess 	 Is it a team in a warm place
Yeah I guess you 're right 	 We still have Mark Ingram though and he 's proven to be pretty good
He has the reputation of being a dirty player but he is effective 	 I feel that every team needs a guy like that in order to really thrive
Oh god yeah talk about a cry fest 	 It 's so good though So good
Cincinnati against the San Francisco 49ers 	 Where was it played
Hopefully They play mostly afternoon games or night games too i hate that 	 Sprcially if it is on a sunday i hate when the NFL tries to go up against The Walking Dead
Yes like the monkey 	 No I have not
Octopuses Garden 	 Dude no way What That 's your favorite song You have terrible taste
Why not focus and try to win a championship in back to back years 	 That would be phenomenal and the city of Chicago would go crazy
I read that somewhere yes 	 DId you know Ed Sheeran would rap Eminem songs to help with his stutter

No I 'm actually more of an Orioles fan 	 I did n't know that What inning is this
He has so many good songs 	 And they are all really catchy
Do n't know look at the Patriots and the Falcons Both teams have fantastic ground games 	 Not everyone is Zeke and not everyone has Cowboys O-line though
I do n't know if they are one hit but they had only one or a few hits 	 Yes I remember Bang your Head by Quiet Riot was big then they had no other hits
Flowers started the final eight games of the regular season finishing with seven sacks 	 True and he capped his year with a key sack of Matt Ryan in the Super Bowl that pushed the Falcons out of field goal range likely saving the Patriots comeback bid
Well how are they like that 	 Because the plots are weird
I liked the first Jack Reacher The second one was dumb 	 No way They were both cool
I keep seeing previews online and they make me laugh so hard 	 Yeah they are hilarious

They were put together for a TV show 	 Really Like the current Boy Band
Its so cute 	 Exactly
He is a guitarist 	 Oh is he
He 's a good vocalist How would you compare A Perfect Circle to Tool 	 Their sound is not quite as loud and heavy as Tool but I think the rhythm and melodies are almost identical in character
I 'm sure they will Rush always sounds amazing 	 I ca n't believe Giddy can still sing like that
A UK band fronted by a teenage girl named Poly Styrene Lots of great songs including my fave My Mind is Like a Plastic Bag 	 Haha funny Does she still perform
I have n't forgotten but receivers mean nothing without someone to get them the ball 	 Same goes for the other way around
They do Quite frequently 	 Do they have other people fill in
Yes very much 	 Do you have any Beatles albums
Back in the name of the song was Into the Night 	 That 's awesome Has Chad Kroeger worked with any other artists

I do n't remember that one but have you seen A Bronx Tale with Dinaro 	 Yes that was one of my favorite movies of all time
Maybe but it 's more of an affectionate parody in that case They 're a fun group 	 What 's your favorite song by them
Oh ok so like a buff version of the runningback 	 Yea kind of Which is crazy because they are all so buff already
I have never heard of John Cassavetes 	 he is a great actor and director
It totally blows my mind 	 Me too It 's like it 's got I am the Walrus Magical Mystery Tour Your Mother Should Know Strawberry Fields Penny Lane Your MOther Should Know All You Need is Love I mean it 's crazy
I would n't think that was so hard 	 It is difficult to do accuratly when you are moving through a peice and need to move on to the next notes
I never would have guessed you liked music with an Asian feel 	 Hey I like to dance to music with an Asian feel
It does look like that 	 I think we 're going to get you guys though
Yeah me too I like techno a lot especially for working out 	 I usually listen to pop music the most though
You would have to wait almost a years There are approximately people on it With under people giving up their tickets per year 	 That 's insane Okay hit me up again

I do n't know it seemed interesting Is it going to have the girl from the first one 	 Sigorney Weaver Nah this one 's based on the Prometheus series
He 's a one of a kind 	 Yes he is
Interesting Which toy is the main character then 	 It 's the dinosaur named Trixie It mainly has dinosaurs in it It 's definitely worth watching
Why not 	 The lack of time and cost of tickets are two issues that I have with attending a game
So a huge song hurts the artist 	 Almost always in this scenario
I would say their most famous song is I Want To Touch You 	 Oh I think I have heard this song What album is it from
Well it did n't make sense to me 	 What did n't make sense
Yeah dude 	 Oh it 's amazing
Metallica and Guns and Roses were touring together and at this show Axl Rose threw a tantrum and refused to perform 	 People started rioting because he would n't perform
It had to be concise though It 's a screenplay not a novel 	 I guess you 're right I just wish there were more
I remember growing up watching The Birds 	 Oh gosh me too I have n't seen it in years
Well there 's a twist to the story 	 What 's the twist
well I guess than you will have to wait till dvd comes out 	 I guess I 'll be going now
What about Stephen Curry 	 That 's my man
Is n't that the one that acts like they are making a movie about Freddy in it 	 Yup that 's the one
Well considering you 're a tax payer you have the right to bring it up to your local officials 	 Yeah I do n't think that 's something I 'm gon na have the determination to do I just thought it was always a weird thing

Oh my goodness yes 	 I still listen to his music
The crowd was too turned up 	 I know it was packed wall to wall
The first game was n't so bad I think we only lost by two points 	 Your right but we had Kawai was in that first game up until the third quarter
Yeah absolutely I get a little obsessed 	 I have to limit myself to just being in two leagues
I know The Rock and Kevin are both hilarious 	 I love the part when Bob slaps Jet during the therapy session
Actually there are no particular artists I kinda listen to whatever comes on the radio but back in the 80s and 90s I like folks like Bel Biv Devoe Snoop Doggy Dog 	 Oh cool I listen to various artists too I like Cent myself
Not just a sporting event THE SPORTING EVENT 	 The Olympics
Yeah I would just say the singer specifically 	 Nickelback was equally as terrible
They do Minecraft music right 	 Yeah they did the music for Minecraft that 's what they 're most famous for
It 's Ryan Gosling It 's great 	 Big Ryan Gosling fan then
Except dumbledore 	 Yea dumbledore expects a lot from him
Actually I think it was Britney Spears 	 I bet that was a great show When did you see her
The one in London 	 Yes that one
I like movies that question what is real and what is fantasy 	 Yeah this one definitely makes you think And it makes you question mental illness as well
But at least we agree 	 Yes it 's a very good movie The genre is just wrong
Perfect and Infinity are the songs I love most on it 	 Were there any other albums he was part of
You make a good point 	 My favorite time of the day is dusk because that 's when the daytime animals are going to sleep and the animals of the evening are just waking up

Thats a while to make a fanbase wait 	 Theyve been patient before
Language is expression of feelings and you ca n't deny them sometimes 	 That 's true

What 's your favorite nightmare on elm street sequel 	 I would say Dream Warriors actually like it nearly as much as the first one
Why it already told all it needed to 	 Right there was nothing left to tell it just went in to like silly stuff
Yes but they all did go on and make some good solo music 	 They sure did Sir Paul and Ringo are still going strong
Well I guess I 'll see you at the show then 	 You definitely will
Hey 	 What plans you got
I mean you have to buy the songs on iTunes 	 I prefer the older way
That 's too hard to say 	 I think it will there have been so many rules since the early 90s as is
Really Do n't you think that marvel universe as far as movies go is got out of hand 	 No It a huge franchise.I mean look at the whole Xmen set of movies you like them right
I 've read them I know all about The Mandarin guy 	 Then you know how they screwed up the story
I saw the new Amy Schumer movie last night 	 Snatched Oh how was it I 'm dying to see it
Yes they fall in love 	 I should see it
For me it was the first one 	 I would probably agree The second and third one just seem to recycle the same jokes
Yeah do you remember the part with the face hugger 	 Yeah that part is so nasty haha
Any other teams 	 I also like Green Bay and the Favre era
Lebron really is showing off how good he is He 's only and has three championships and been in four other finals 	 Something like that It 's crazy I thought Steph Curry would be the next one but he 's only three years younger than Lebron
They started At least they were competitive 	 If he starts enough games he can be top tier after this contract
he does have a lot of miles on his tires 	 whole seasons of playoff basketball
How would you describe the sub genres of music they play 	 I would say between psychedelic rock to pop rock to gospel rock if that 's even a sub genre
Yes every team must have one They play Buffalo in November on a Thursday 	 Will the Jets running game hold up
I do n't have that one 	 I think it 's their best material that I 've heard
So are you coming with me to see her on her next appearance locally 	 What ever the cost I have to go
nirvana were simple but powerful 	 their melodies were important
He had some good songs like I gon na Miss Her 	 Oh yea that was the one about fishing
I 'm sure a lot are special effects 	 Yes but the scene itself is creepy
No in fact I do n't think they 'll win the NFC south this year 	 Who do you think will win
The songs are the best I love the monkey 's song that 's got to be one of the best Disney songs of all time 	 I even love just the background music too it reminds me of Disneyland
My heart is wounded 	 And it will heal But you have to know that this is a song that speaks the truth
I know That is what everyone always tells me 	 Who is your favorite actor or actress
She actaully does now that you mention it 	 Even in serious movies She 's just not a likeable character
No after the debauchery that the studios passed off as parts thru tanked so bad I 'm just afraid the other movies will be just as disappointing 	 Well i kind of liked the first
Did you hear that Gwen Stefani got a divorce 	 Who was she married to
That 's sort of the point 	 No I just thought she was mean and not in a fun way
Are you excited to see Tristan und Isolde next week 	 We 're really going to that
He is a big deal Good looking too 	 Like Zac Effron
Yeah that was the league really messing that up 	 I am glad they no longer made it have such big implications
What do they do 	 Well just simple dumb stuff like recording a caterpillar
Which one 	 Bad Romance
the 2nd was bad enough 	 I do n't know why they even made a third
Something like the Birds 	 That movie made me so afraid of birds for years

Which popular singer do you respect the most 	 Over what time frame
Ca n't wait for it to begin 	 What team are you going for this year
I remember being in middle school and Roll Out was pretty popular I loved that 	 Yes most of the songs on that album Word of Mouf were good
Yep which another innovative technique used by the beatles 	 That was the very first time feedback was used as a part of a recording and performance
I think that 's true for most bands I understand why well known bands play the bigger shows but the sound is n't nearly as good 	 Well they have to support the tour with ticket sales Its not like bands make a ton of money off cds and albums anymore
I think people are spoiled nowadays with all the action Not everything needs to move a mile a minute 	 Agreed There Will Be Blood is a good example of the benefits of slow storytelling
Yes I watched it when I was young 	 Did you like it
Do you like the newer star wars movies 	 Yeah I like them a lot
Yep A perfect example is The Room which is popular enough so that you might recognize it Have you seen it 	 YOU 'RE TEARING ME APART LISA
You 'd need to do a study All you 'd need to do is find people who do n't know that Vader is Luke 's father and show them the movies 	 I think that would be impossible
And what about Weedfest Are they still making that 	 They said yes but they wanted to get Super Troopers made first
Not just because of that I thought it was really well done 	 Yeah it did win the Oscar
You 're a fan of WWE wrestling right Did you see that movie The Marine 	 No I have n't seen it yet Why is there a wrestler in it
Im really into jazz 	 Well well well We have a huge selection of jazz
Well you 'll like this then The son thinks the monster in a pop-up book is real and he makes weapons to defend himself and his mother 	 So the kid is the hero
Whoa that 's wild 	 Yeah but the rats are pretty scary in the movie and have electric spears
Whatever happened to Deangelo 	 I do n't know but that first album of his was lit
I do n't like Jesus 	 -LRB- glares at him -RRB-

Did you know that Ewoks are miniture versions of Wookies 	 How do you mean
Sometimes I really like Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran you 	 I love Katy Perry And that new song Despacito
Oh man I loved that music when I was growing up 	 Right
After the 1st round none of their games have been that competitive 	 Lebron James is just running over people
The last ones were not so good 	 They had too much going one in them
Hi 	 Hey
Oh heck no just left the cap lock on lol 	 lol
That is always the dilemma I say start with the Harrison Ford ones 	 Which movie do I watch first
It was a drug overdose 	 That 's truly a shame
Did they replace these with computer generated imagery 	 I do n't know for sure but they probably did
Good it is a game you do not want to miss it is honestly the best one i have seen for them this season 	 Is it How good was it
Me too I did n't think he would want to get involved 	 It made for a good song though
they wan na take the good out of everything 	 i get what you mean
Ah yes Keyser Soze 	 It was pretty interesting to watch the story unfold
I usually do im betting my buddy they win by runs 	 I think thats a safe bet i heard they are supposed to beat the royals fairly easily

First of all Tina Fey is the one who is the party girl 	 You mean when they were younger right Because I remember they are supposed to be having a house party for some reason

What was it 	 I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy
I do n't know 	 Why do you say that
Yes I liked how all the stories bled into one another 	 Yes but some characters never even met Like Bruce Willis and Travolta their characters never meet

Bruec Willis in his prime 	 I know He was the man back then
Me too They were also great in Sleepless in Seattle 	 Totally Have they been in any movies together recently
I do n't know but that first album of his was lit 	 Remember the one Me and My Dreaming Eyes

Ah yeah I know that jazz is famous for improvisation 	 Big Band was basically jazz made more palatable for the masses

Yes the Pittsburgh Steelers will be there again 	 The Patriots have the Steelers number though
I think it will be so stereotypical that it will be tied at the end and whoever recieves the ball will win it 	 So a coin toss will determine that game
Another of my favorites Gene Wilder is the best 	 I know so sad he passed away
Do you still listen to his music 	 Yes I do and I still like it but i 've matured past his older stuff
Did you know Arnold Schwarzenegger was originally offered the role of John McClane 	 Really I ca n't picture Arnold Schwarzenegger in Die Hard
It is scheduled to begin October 	 Who do you think will play in the World Series this year
How do you think the Patriots will do this season 	 They 'll probably do great like always
Did you catch Step Brothers on TV last night 	 Yeah but I 'm not a fan of it
I 'm just not feeling them 	 but they glow in the dark
I 'm just not knowledgable about football 	 You could study
What change do you dislike the most 	 Probably that music number from Return of the Jedi called Jedi Rocks It changes the whole tone of the scene and it extremely annoying
That 's fine with me 	 Awesome then.see you at
I see what you mean Carry That Weight by The Beatles is a good example 	 Yeah it was epic It sounded like a classical song at some parts
Yeah I had n't seen the first one but it was a fun movie 	 Oh man thats great I ca n't wait to go see it
I 've been listening to this station that plays old rock 'n' roll and it seems like every singer is the original writer 	 You do n't see that as much these days It 's like pop stuff music is saturated with formulaic approaches
Yeah how do you top coming from the biggest deficit ever and winning a super bowl 	 Well you could win back to back super bowls
They have played more than games since 	 That is a lot
He is funny too 	 I love his quick wit and confidence
Yeah and they had the duo with Run DMC 	 That was a song meant to appeal to other fans in different genres
Wow really I did n't know you like country music so much 	 Well it 's not so much that but he 's an amazing artist with such a great voice
And they have speed on the opposite side too 	 Yeah that guy who played at Miami
Why do you think it 's bad 	 It 's hard to get a loyal fan base when there 's a chance a team might move
I guess it was recorded but ceelo 's record choose to scrap it 	 what why would they do that
Is it still in theaters 	 Yes it is
Cool What other vampire movies do you like 	 Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein is great cause Dracula is in it But it 's pretty comedic
See you soon then 	 Yeah for sure
Classic is always good 	 Well duh
I was really touched when he proceeded to try to get right back out there to race That scene when he was painfully trying on his helmet despite his burn wounds made me want to pull for him to come out ahead 	 His wife though was so supportive Did n't you think she was such a sympathetic character
I really miss getting to watch Troy Polamalu 	 he was a total raging beast on the field
Just because they 're dead does n't mean they were n't great Elvis Presley and John Lennon are both dead And they 're still considered legends 	 Legends is right They 're dead
It 's one of my favorites 	 Who else is in it
What type of music have you been listening to lately 	 I found my old ipod and started listening to my old songs Some of them I had even forgotten
I disagree I think in filming Rogue One they were straining for plot ideas 	 But just think of it it 's the archetypical story of a group of misfits who sacrifice themselves for high ideals
Yes I ca n't wait 	 Which bands are you hoping to see
Well you have notes you have certain scales there 's a finite number of bits to music that make it sound good 	 You 're saying we could hit an upper limit on song structures
Well they came in last place in the NFC West last season 	 I understand that but did n't they improve
she was a great singer and ab souls girlfriend 	 kendrick used her well in the song too
True but this is a different team 	 We will see
They 'll have a tough time forgetting that debacle 	 Good thing is ther are a young team
They have got a lot better 	 Yes And the record shows it
Yep 	 Cool
Yes he is and he is a team leader 	 I really get sick of people bashing the lions
They may be a better team this year 	 Why is that
It is a good album but my favorite is wildest dreams 	 Also a good song in truth I like every song on that album
Does he play any instruments as well 	 He has a signature guitar that he likes to use for live performances He also plays the accordion
Do you know who Lady Gaga is 	 Of course
Wow What was your favorite part 	 I like the Shiny scene with the Crab
Are Maroon a British band 	 Oh no they are very much from the United States They are mostly from Los Angeles
Really That 's neat I 'm amazed by how much information about the characters they gave you with so little dialogue 	 Yeah it 's hard to believe Wall-e never says a word except eva
Oh man I wish I could 've seen that Yeah as an asexual I find him really relateable 	 But I thought you referred to some of the cast members as attractive
I wonder how he was recruited 	 How do the Sith recruit
Yea playing a role and being alone has to be hard 	 He was not alone he had that soccer ball to keep him company
WHat s it about 	 This guy he was like a hitman but he fell in love So he left it But then his wife dies
THANKS I KNOW JUST THE FRIEND I WILL ASK TO COME 	 I NO YOU BOTH WILL ENJOY THE MOVIES AND I KNOW IT WILL MAKE ALL OF US HAPPY
I used to love them 	 Me too
I know It 's amazing that there were so many 	 Some of them were cute but some of them scared me
Well i guess 	 I mean they could have sounded different
Yes I also liked the title track called No Boundaries 	 When did No Boundaries come out
Well she starts off by getting them to write things 	 So they have hands and can hold things Why are aliens always humanistic
Really I think she has some talent 	 I think she 's kind of overrated
Well her new album is about a break up and it 's anything but vapid 	 I mean a break-up pop album Everybody does that
I like Dalton he has good numbers 	 I think Drew Bree 's days are limited What do you think will be top defense
Brewers for real or do they fall back to earth 	 Good one That 's still tough to tell I 'd guess they do n't win the central but could still be in the WC mix
i know right i ca n't wait for the season to start 	 i think training camp is two weeks away
Boy it 's been awhile My favorite act was the Shins though 	 That 's awesome I 've been a fan of there 's since I saw Garden State
It is sad he passed away 	 Yes it is
Drum machines are n't that bad it 's the auto-tune garbage 	 Which artists are doing that a lot lately
What does that have to do with anything 	 Well I loved her song it was incredible
I definitely love Return of the Jedi the most out of the three 	 Why do you like Return of the Jedi more than the other two movies
Let me know what you think of them after you listen to them 	 I definitely will
I always wished the movie told us what they were 	 I guess some things we will never know
You would think they would figure out that they are cutting out a huge portion of their audience by including stuff like that 	 Yes it is disappointing that the industry leaders have not figured that out
They 're playing really well right now 	 The Colorado Rockies
THAT ALWAYS HELPS SELL THE DISNEYS DOESNT IT 	 AND THE STORY LINE ITS ALMOST HISTORICAL
Exactly They are all street racers who then become heist experts fighters and save the country 	 I do think that the series has redeeming qualities in spite of the criticisms
Who is it 	 Tom Holland I believe it 's his first big film
You 're probably right No one could play in that heat without having serious problems 	 It would give them a great home advantage like Minnesota has for weather though
Yes I will head to a Cardinals game when I visit home around Thanksgiving 	 Wow that sounds fun the Cardinals can do good this season
I will go ahead and buy the album if I like it 	 Awesome
I think maybe Mike Trout 	 What about Bryce Harper
Ill have to go to walmart 	 Same
I agree with you on that she is not the strongest vocalist But I love her from the harry potter movies 	 Harry Potter films are great In a fun childish escape way
For sure Gin and Juice is stuck in my head now 	 That song is a classic
I just have a question about movies you 've watched 	 Okay
Do you think Ron Howard will do him justice 	 He has a few sort of Sci-fi type movies
Oh yea that one was kinda meh to me 	 Just something feels off about it
its in hiphop 	 mmmh have we ever heard it together
Some are fathers to kids and that is dangerous 	 Yeah something bad could happen
Oh it 's not a comedy it 's an action movie But they did incorporate a bit of humor I thought it was a good touch 	 Yes I like action movies with humor too So did you enjoy the movie was it a new plot or a bit expected
Why not 	 My puppy only dances when I put her in spandex
Oh you know it Every year we are contenders for the Super Bowl 	 I think the head office had a really strong draft this year
Well they traded Stauskas picks and pick swaps for nothing and It did n't work 	 True they needed to clear space for free agents and they got none anyway
Speaking of which are you going to try and see Wonder Woman opening night 	 No I 'll probably wait a few days so I can go when the theater is less crowded
He was a funny guy 	 The head Gungan talked funny
It could last for hours it lasts for however long it takes for a team to break the tie 	 Oh that would be a site to see
People pick their own fashion they dont look to the stars anymore 	 I think with the birth of the internet you might be right
Sounds like that could be trouble 	 It is it gets him into some trouble That 's where the comedy comes in
That is highly possible But the veterans are n't doing so hot either 	 I really hope it 's a temporary slump
Oh that 's right The Icky Shuffle 	 That 's right
That blocky shape is truly unflattering on the foot 	 So I take it pointy toes will be making a come back
Deniro Paccino Killmer 	 I think Val was my favorite
That is also a very funny part 	 It has been a long time since I watched that movie
I really like Mulholland Drive but generally his stuff is too out there for me I do n't need everything spelled out but some of it is nonsense 	 Yeah Eraserhead is possibly the worst movie I 've ever seen except for a bunch of others
I think I 've seen them play before What are their colors 	 Purple and orange and their mascot is a tiger Their coach right now is Dabo Swinney
I love Need to Breathe Switchfoot Tobymac and Lauren Daigle 	 Lauren Daigle has such a unique voice
Did you know that it is based on a true story 	 Wow that 's pretty messed up
Well in the AL the Yankees are very dominate as much as I hate to say it NL is a complete toss up but it is still early 	 Yeah I do n't think the Yankees will stay this strong
Punk and hardcore mostly what about you 	 Same Ca n't you see my jacket with the Black Flag and Misfits patches
Oh you are missing out 	 Have you ever been to any of his concerts
Hopefully olaf is in it 	 I hope so
Do you remember watching the Lion King 	 I remember going to the theater as a kid
I would say there were around bands 	 What was the best part of the concert
Me too They 've made some amazing animations 	 You know Steve Jobs started that company
Lion King has always been very memorable for me with Elton John 's Circle of Life song 	 Lion King is always on everyone 's top list because of the memorable songs in there plus it 's one of Disney 's most powerful animations too
Is n't there also a Justice League movie 	 Yes They actually wanted to make that before finishing Aquaman
Like Yoda 	 Yes or Like A Surgeon
Yeah that 's right He 's really come into success with his TV career 	 Pretty in Pink was a John Hughes movie was n't it
What 's your favorite Bobby Brown song 	 My favorite Bobby Brown song is On our own
darth maul was super cool 	 anakin and obi were great
Yeah do n't they get played on classic rock radio nowadays 	 Yeah they do but I 'd recommend their albums from the '80s They were pretty heavy and technical back then
It is like they got the general idea but failed to follow through 	 Exactly
What 's it about 	 It 's based on Thomas Hardy 's eighteen-ninety-five novel about a fascinating but restless woman and the men she ruins by her coquetry
And it 's always good to have music in other languages 	 That 's true I only have English and Spanish at the moment
Oh that 's really cool What are some of the better artists that do 8-bit 	 I like Dubmood a lot but Bitshifter is also really good
I think it was just the time it came out but really spoke to me it 's my favorite album of all time 	 Well that would make sense then That was the one with Cleaning Out My Closet right
I might but I really ca n't waste money on chances very often 	 Maybe try a free concert Some parks and businesses host free concert series especially in the summer
Me too 	 I need to watch it again
That 's good What kind of music do they like 	 Some country some pop Basically whatever I play
No I have n't 	 Hey I 'm not the biggest country fan but chicken fried by Zac Brown is awesome
It is really funny and exciting 	 Yes I remember thank you for reminding me
Incredible Never saw it coming 	 That 's what made it such a great show
I hope its good because the franchise has been good 	 I think the last spiderman with Tobey Maguire was a bit boring
Yeah Public Image Ltd is super moody A band can only make so many true punk albums before they 're just writing the same song 	 I do n't know if I agree with that I mean look at The Descendents
So is the last Jedi Luke or is it Rey 	 I 'm not sure I bet it could go either way but I imagine it is probably Luke
Reading the newspaper really gets me down 	 I agree let 's go see a great movie
Have you seen the one for Sixteen Military Wives 	 No Should I
What kind of animation Japanese kind Anime 	 Oh well I guess I 'm not such a big fan of that kind of anime
The people he had over totally trashed his house It was destroyed 	 Yeah but that was more Caroline 's fault for bringing everyone there I could n't stand her character
What 's that song about 	 Not drugs It 's actually about him and a childhood girlfriend
That movie was kind of dark and mysterious I want something lighter 	 You ca n't make all movies all rainbows and unicorns though
Yeah they got a good team but I think they got lucky last year 	 Dak was a beast
And the dogs that talk 	 Squirel
he does that a lot 	 just taking the piss out of music and stuff
I think Yesterday and Blackbird are a tie 	 I love Blackbird
And digital getdown was a fun song 	 I remember that song
Anyway the Despasito song seems like it should n't work on paper but its pretty good and I really like it 	 I 've heard it I 'm not crazy about it
I was thinking Bloodsport I love when they fight in the Kumate 	 Okay then after Bloodsport lets do a great Chinese flick Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon
How about that Michael Myers Character 	 Ugg yea he killed his sister
Oh me too I still love that song though 	 Ugh I am so tired of it I hope the songs in Frozen are less catchy
Yes he is 	 I like watching him
yeah one of the best concerts of all time 	 Must have been something special
What one is that 	 Fifty ton war machine
Yes I was disappointed in both 	 I saw the fourth and thought that it was just average and generic
Well I like a lot of his old songs but I really do n't like any of his new pieces 	 Really You do n't like 24K
What about the other games 	 They lost and
That is a great suggestion I love Tim McGraw and Faith Hill 	 I do too Did you know that Tim and Faith have been married for years
They actually have gotten quite a few new players i think they are gon na go far 	 I love them so i hope they go far this season
Oh yeah how was that 	 It was horrible
Heartbeat 	 Yes it 's a good song
Maybe but she is committed to two more at the same salary 	 Goodness That is not much
I agree the setting is really scary 	 I guess that 's what makes a good thriller though right
Oh yea -LRB- laughs -RRB- I have seen that I remember the hate from the media Man that was a long time ago 	 to be exact I also really love anything with Jim Carrey
Plus they 've got that new center from up north 	 Yeah i think the kid is from international falls
Did you know the Celtics also had turnovers 	 I did and that is one of the main reasons they lost the game
It was sad of her passing and her daughter 	 Yes it was I found a cd of hers did you ever get Whitney Houston live
I can understand now why you do n't think the Dolphins will win more than games 	 Yeah I just ca n't see it I know their defense is overrated especially with all the big names they brought in like Suh but I do n't see them competing for a Superbowl
Would you rather the flying car or the timeturner 	 Time turner BY far you could go and do whatever you want
I think so his career has a specific trajectory that comes to light if you follow it from the beginning If you dive in at the end it 'll seem really strange 	 Strange how Because of the cross-genre approach
Wow all these local artists I 've never heard of I 'll have to get out to some more live music shows 	 There 's every kind of music every weekend If you are looking for something softer like Jazz music there 's The Apollo Trio and they are amazing
Sure but the media was all about the Tennessee Titans It was hard for Jerry Jones to compete 	 I 'd imagine but they enjoy the game just the same You follow the NFL draft keep up with who 's on waivers
Like I said just look the album up You wo n't be disappointed 	 Alright then Let 's put your words to the test
I like that Beyonce is trying to get everyone in formation 	 For sure Jay Z who
Hi how are you today 	 Doin just fine super ready for the weekend
Oh yeah you should also check out Southern Rock Opera which is the best album he made with Drive By Truckers 	 Are his live shows any good

What did you think of The Babadook 	 Loved it now that I finally got a chance to watch it Far too often nidern day horror is disappointing
What position does she play 	 She 's a kicker
But he 's a good director and a great writer 	 I 'll check out Annie Hall
Lets just agree it should be Lebron 	 OK and lets also agree the Spurs would be fun to keep watching
Alright do you have it 	 Yeah I have the DVD I will bring it the next time we see each other
Yes but only as the voice of Megatron 	 He 's in V for Vendetta
The one hong kong guy 	 Name names dude
I just hope it is better than Suicide Squad 	 I do as well I felt like the bad guy for suicide squad was too big of a villain for that group
I watched it too It was at friend 's house My friend loves the beast and i do n't know why 	 Do you remember that movie we were watching when we where kids You know the mermaid
Yea I dont know if they can do that 	 Neither do I but we will find out
Do you like Coheed and Cambria 	 Yes I think they make great music
Yeah because I like action 	 I have not seen it yet
Sure How many baseball players have huge pirate-style beards 	 He 's the only one coming to mind right now
I get it The animation is fine with me 	 The animation is weird and since it 's new that means the humor is weird
IS YOU PLANNING ON GOING TO SEE IT 	 YES I AM PLANNING TO GO TO SEE IT
I like Adele a bit 	 What song
Actually she 's Croatian and from New Zealand 	 She 's won so many awards so young and I think she has staying power
I mean it was funny when it came out because I was a teenager After a while it was lame 	 I guess I never grew up
A year later 	 What 's that one like
Yeah The guy she let sweep her off her feet is disguised with a ridiculous moustache 	 Because false facial hair is a recipe for comedy
That sounds a little dramatic 	 You have no idea how much idea I love this song
Like a Virgin 	 that is a great one what else
You into sports 	 I like some
Sure is Rambo really does some damage 	 I do n't blame him They should 've just left him alone
What do you think the differences are between the books and movies 	 I think that there are a lot of differences they left a lot of details out of the movies that was in the books
Yes it is pretty good I liked it alot more before the radio stations overplayed it 	 I just think it 's amazing that Ed Sheeran went from playing at subways and street corners to being a mega superstar
I remember parts of it 	 What do you remember from it
I do have to admit the animation was top notch seeing all those things turn into real life action compared to the previous animated version 	 I thought they did an exceptional job with it especially with the candle and clocks movements and their actions I loved it
Yeah and backing Joni Mitchell at the first Playboy Fest when she was doing Mingus stuff 	 I vaguely remember that I was n't ready for her doing jazz
NOT YET 	 HOW WILL YOU LIKE TO GO WITH ME

What was the most recent superhero movie that you saw 	 I watched guardians of the galaxy recently
Nicholson won The Academy Award for Best Actor I think 	 Yes he did
I always have trouble keeping the timelines straight with all those movies 	 Luckily with this one it is set in the future and most of the mutants are dead so you do n't have to worry about timelines
You can argue he was just inspired 	 Is it true he uses a fake accent
What is your favorite rock band 	 My favorite rock band is Guns and Roses
He did It felt like such a natural role for him 	 I also thought that Michael Pena 's character was hilarious
Well I do n't know if it 's my favorite one but it definitely is a classical one You have to see Pulp Fiction 	 Really But is n't it like an old movie from the 's
Agreed he 's been fantastic in all of the films how many are there now 	 I believe this was number
Oh I forgot about that 	 Yeah I love those cermonies when they raise it
Joe Pantoliano is also a great character in this film he is such a good bad guy 	 Agreed he is also great in the matrix
He was alright 	 Just alright he was a genius robot
Oh yeah forgot he was a poor Irishman 	 Its not that its that hes played better roles in crappy movies too

I am not sure if you had 	 I am looking for some things and i can not seem to find them
Music isnt the same anymore 	 No I 'm afraid ita not
That 's right I forgot about that I love disaster movies So how does The Space Between Us play out 	 I 'm not going to spoil it for you because I want you to see it I think you 'd like it a lot Asa 's ca n't survive Earth for long because his blood 's density does n't balance within the Earth 's atmosphere so Gary Oldman and Carla Cugino try to track him down as he 's escaped to visit Britt
No players trade teams all the time 	 I guess you are right

You mean Rogue One Yes it was awesome 	 You liked it I thought it was confusing
Me too he has a certain type of mystery 	 And he does all kinds of movies
What about you 	 You may hate my answer because you like him
I agree My favorite had to be Katy Perry though She shocked everyone in that red dreary veil and custom crimson Galliano coat 	 Yes that outfit was definitely inspiring What also caught my eye was Bella Hadid in a tight black crystal embellished jumpsuit custom made by Alexander Wang
Her hair is always perfect 	 Exactly
I usually listen to XM and do n't catch a lot of rap 	 Oh I see
No you tell me first 	 But why

Where is he from anyway 	 Grew up in Honolulu and had a lot of music influence while growing up
Are you going to see the live action Beauty and the Beast 	 I do n't know I love the animated one so much
Yeah it was kind of unnessecary and poorly thought out 	 It was at that was n't it
I think Kramer Robertson is on par with being as good or better then the former LSU player Alex Bregman 	 Woahh I 'll believe it when I see it man but I do love Kramer He 's a great shortstop
The record for most team fumbles in a season belongs to the Chicago Bears They fumbled times 	 Ouch that had to hurt
Corben Bernsen is good as an actor 	 Yes he is Did he start on a televison show
Good I hope you like him 	 Where 's he from Age
But the new movies do n't have the same great writing or inventiveness and the acting is miserable by comparison 	 I would n't say that Mark Hamil was particularly talented would you
why the message is n't all that great it 's not very historically accurate 	 the music is beautiful and does have a great message
Definitely recommend 	 I so rarely GO to the movies though They 're so expensive here
And my ears were n't really trained to think of that stuff as good until more recently 	 Yeah because disco was severely underrated by rock fans and critics
My favorite band is The Beatles 	 Why do you like them
Yeah that thing with his dad was scary 	 Did you like the date scene
Guy Ritchie and some other people I ca n't remember Nobody ridiculously famous 	 What 's so great about it
Marvin Jones and Golden Tate are returning so that 's promising for me I thought they did really good as the Lions main wide receivers 	 Golden Tate was always dependable in Seattle for the Seahawks I 'm glad to see him get to be the main guy over there in Detroit
He was the king of pop all his songs were popular 	 Haha I guess you 're right
I might try that some time 	 You should
He also had rebounds 	 They really came back at the end of the game
Thanks if I win I will take you 	 That would be awesome
Wow I 'm surprised I did n't hear about this one 	 Yeah it came out like ten years ago
Thats tough because there was an influx of artists at that time 	 I could argue it was Creed
Do you think the ghost of Yoda will be in the next movie 	 I sure hope so that little alien is my favorite
Not sure I do n't keep up much with AFC 	 They 've got Andrew Luck
Yeah like Sebastian from the Little Mermaid Mrs. Potts from Beauty and the Beast 	 Exactly but one of my favorite elements of all movies is the interactions that people have between each other
Ah you 're one of those comedy movie type people then 	 Yeah that 's usually what I prefer to watch over some really serious movie like a horror or scifi or drama
That 's true I 'm sure you 've heard that a lot 	 I do And then I have to tell them I liked them with Bledsoe was still the quarterback and that helps a little
Well stop it is not funny 	 I think it is

I love him and faith hill together 	 They are so cute
Really 	 Yeah Bruce Wayne sent her the original copy of her photo in the movie
Yes A Clockwork Orange was in the 's 	 Was that good
I know I love when he worked with pop artists like Rihanna and Taylor Swift 	 I think he really knows how to enhance the female voice
I 've watched some of their live clips on YouTube they seem super fun 	 They were awesome My brother went with me and he caught one of the drummer 's drum sticks It was a pretty sweet night
Yes sounds like a plan 	 The movie even has some behind the scenes stuff
Do you have some songs you could recommend from The Fame Monster I could check out 	 Sure My favorites are PokerFace and Papparazi
I 've been loving Teen Dream an Bloom 	 You have a favorite song
I might if I find it at a good price 	 I got it for dollars
Not at all Even the early stuff has some cool melodic bass and pop elements that set them apart 	 So it 's not just blues rock or typical hard rock of the era
Overall I enjoyed it 	 I want to see the new Alien movie

You 're copying V. 	 Yes Sorry I did n't mean to Start over The epic saga of the most violent man who has ever walked the face of the earth the one who has had the dream of conquering the world since the death of His father onw who gleed at the thought of raping women and spreading his DNA over so widely in men descend directly from Kahn himself
You 're right I like him though 	 I like Edelman too but Malcolm Mitchell is my favorite Patriots receiver

It has Michael Rappaport and Robert Duvall 	 I like Robert Duvall Was n't he in Apocalypse Now
What about their running backs 	 Demarco Murray did pretty well I think he was third in rushing yards last season
It was in the early 80s I might have even been 	 It was such a fun song to listen to

I just thought the prequels did n't get the credit they deserved 	 The critics were pretty rough
Like her appearance 	 And the backstory
The whole order went into hiding you would think that would be grey 	 It was hence them all dying awful deaths in the movies well most
Talk aboout long time coming 	 Yeah he 's deserved it for years
Their uniform is Gold and Black 	 Sometimes it is White and Gold
I enjoyed the scenes with DeLorean and Doc 	 And all of the cool scenes with the hoverboard

I remember that 	 But she did at the end
Do you think they will put out another album soon 	 I sure hope so I love their music
Yeah you can say that for sure 	 I know I think it 's just one of those things actors do to get under their skin they antagonize them on set
That was a good development Passing instead of running was good for football 	 Were n't there a lot of Hall of Famers on the 49ers

They 're from the UK British 	 What kind of music did they make
What do you think of it 	 It is very catchy but I do n't know if it 's my cup of tea
I definitely like to see a game played at its fullest to the final whistle 	 Andew Luck is a great quarterback who has a knack for making late game-winning comebacks
He is their star player no doubt 	 They could not have chosen a better player Matt Ryan is the tops
Well for one thing I like how they use their harmonies together And they sound like they have so much fun singing together 	 Like in Barbara Ann

Well for starters there was nobod bigger than him and his fame never really dies like the beatles He was a stand out artist and unique there was never another like him 	 I agree with that but i still think the beatles changed the world and music
I 'm not sure there 's loads of both movies though 	 They 're classics They do n't make horror movies like that anymore
When they were playing Tupac songs 	 Yeah that song is so cool
I got it for dollars 	 Kewl where
I see where you 're going Not good enough to move forward too good to get good picks 	 Yeah free agents do n't see them as worthy and drafting in the middle so they ca n't get those franchise players
It is a cool job but not that important 	 Entertainers make a lot of money

He is strong and fast 	 Yes he is
Let 's say in the past years 	 Good because otherwise I 'd probably say some decade during like BC

Why such a short time 	 It was just designed that way
It was really creepy too 	 Yes it was have you seen the alternate ending
Yes But wow to have all of the characters die one after the other 	 They really believed in the cause
I love that song 	 It really is a great album
Well firstly why 's it called Dalmations and secondly how is Cruella de Vil supposed to make a coat out of them 	 Firstly they meet more Dalmations when Cruella kidnaps them hence the coat
i was hoping to talk about it today but okay 	 Sorry man
I can sort of see where you 're coming from 	 It 's like feeling the bliss of connecting with a higher power and the feeling of listening to an achingly beautiful song
I loved his music he was also an icon which helped 	 He was a musical and lyrical genius
Well Mack is faster younger a bit less banged up 	 That is a good point Kuechly was out much of the year
Me too and I think De Niro plays a great gangster 	 Yes it is hard to watch him in other roles
Not bad 	 Good You into baseball

What do you think of A Nightmare On Elm Street 	 Oh god that was gross
God I hope not I think girls are weird 	 Why
I agree the coach is crucial to the team There have been some great ones over the years like Bill Walsh Chuck Knoll and Don Shula 	 I love watching these kinds of coaches become commentators once they retire Their perspective is so insightful
No it 's not an happy answer because that only addresses the commonality of the scale as opposed to minute nuances of the scales 	 Nuance another BIG word for you
I like Casablanca 	 What about lesser known movies Casablanca Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind are so overplayed
I guess thats the direction they are going 	 I think so and thats where itll stay
What about Matt Ryan 	 He is with the Atlanta Falcolns and
I wo n't I will say that the action sequences were incredible as well 	 Wow you 're really making me want to see it
Players hated each other fans hated each other coaches hated each other the good old days 	 Right and then the Raiders stunk it up were terrible for the last years and the Broncos moved on
Have you heard of George Strait 	 Yes George Strait has a big concert coming up in Las Vegas
I do n't know I think it 's just more of the content 	 Meaning what

Why not 	 I thought it had too haphazard of a story line
How long has it been since they last put out a record 	 Not that long Their last album was called American Beauty/American Psycho and that was released in
I ca n't say anything about that 	 Yay The Rolling Stone Gim me Shelter
A Clockwork Orange is also another good Stanley Kubrick movie 	 I do n't think I 've seen that one
Yes you read it too 	 Look at the author name
Yes It looks like it will be really good 	 Gal Gadot seems to be a great choice for Wonder Woman
well i know the vikings have never won 	 yep and neither have tons of others
Well that 's subjective But in all seriousness you ca n't beat the characters in Jackie Brown 	 Well that 's subjective too
speaking of pop i would still say no one beats Michael Jackson 	 That guy is a legend
Star wars 	 Are they good

no I 'm not familiar with this singer 	 she 's only yrs old

Let 's talk about music 	 Okay what music should we talk about
I ca n't believe the Patriots are still winning after all these years 	 Yeah it 's embarrassing that they just wo n't get bad
I agree 	 It was great talking to you
It 's like a shot of adrenaline and it does n't let go The song Wake Up I used to listen to on my way to work if I had a long day ahead of me 	 And of course it has the infamous Killing in the Name
Did you see the film The Babadook 	 yes i liked it did you
Oh absolutely I have a few game soundtracks that I listen to 	 Oh yeah what games

I believe so Michelle Williams is also very good in it 	 Does she play his wife

I think they tried a bit too hard though Natalie Portman was good as Queen Amadala 	 She was fantastic Rey from Force Awakens kind of reminds me of her a bit
Aerosmith 	 Really
I sure did The tickets look amazing I love the new deisgn 	 Same here brotha I hope your pretty pumped about getting to go to London for the October 1st game
That 's really cool what are the songs about 	 Most of them are about depression and drugs kind of dark stuff
Well in the next month or two 	 Well i will be their for sure
Right And even if you do n't like his lyrics it just sounds so good 	 Yeah his lyrics have never been that great to me but he has gotten so egotistical and crass
Tin pan alley was the most favorite of them all if you ask me 	 Perhaps It was the biggest for sure But Europe has richer publishing history than the US
You know I really liked the Prisoner of Azkaban That movie and book marked a poignant time in the characters direction 	 Yeah it definitely took a turn for the dark I kind of think as far as the movies the first was really good
They are my schools home team so I sort of feel like they must be my fave team 	 Well that sounds cool Who do they play
I 'm super right The character Relatable The side characters Even more relatable 	 Jealousy was pretty funny I guess
It 's probably because of the stigma of them being arrogant and such 	 I do n't really see that in them though
That is extremely cheap Are you sure they are real 	 Yes I purchased them from livenation.com
What 's your favorite song of his 	 Philadelphia Freedom is my favorite

Do you really want to see Queen or Adam Lambert 	 That 's funny but actually both
Do you think they will make it to the super bowl this year 	 I 'm not sure I know they will do well but they have a lot of young guys on defense and have a lot of work to do to get there
Then the chargers again and then the chiefs eagles and New England 	 Wow they do have a tough schedule
Forte would run him over 	 In his dreams
I will say that Big Red was sad honestly I watched that as a child and will never forget how I cried 	 I had n't thought of that movie That one 's an oldie
That 's so true but the falcons have an insanely better defense than the Saints 	 I do n't know if Atlanta 's defense is as good as Tampa Bay 's though they kept Tampa in so many games this year
And that makes it beautiful 	 The fact that there 's so much space in the music lets you really hear what 's going on
What was the final score of that game 	 It was to The kicker hit a last-second field goal to win the game

Yes I still enjoyed the movie Also Daisy Ridley is just a phenomenal actress 	 She really is I ca n't believe that this was her first major role in a film
That was a really powerful scene Luke looking out into Tatooine 's two suns as John Williams score started to play 	 I think it 's impossible not to think about John Williams when thinking about Star Wars
Well that would be interesting 	 I mean they could take a more visual approach

Pretty decent band sure 	 And what about The Guess Who and the Band
Do you wish the Beatles were still around today 	 Yes I do
Yeah so Jackson 's character is a little dubious and he tells a tall tale or two He slowly worms his way into a conversation with this man who plainly hated him and at first it just looks like he is trying to find mutual ground with him 	 Let me guess the old man has a bounty on his head
Kurt Russell joins the cast 	 I 'm a big fan of his I love Escape from New York
I know I miss seeing him 	 There wo n't be another like him
He would often go into a music studio and create entire songs without the need for anyone else 	 How come we do n't hear more about Prince 's musical abilities
Why 	 Because I have been telling you for years that my music was worth listening to I feel vindicated
We 're going to watch She Wore a Yellow Ribbon tonight Want to join us 	 Oh no thanks I 'm not into John Wayne movies
I 'm going to buy some of his dad 's other albums I do n't think he was very famous though 	 Well if it was n't for Prince 's father getting into music we would n't have Purple Rain

cause you alwauys have some good memories that make it worth it 	 well that depends on the situation
I couldnt agree more to be honest 	 I just couldnt imagine never hearing those songs
Absolutely and it seems the ones that got caught up in the steroids are not getting into the Hall of Fame too fast either 	 Yeah guys like Mickey Mantle were pretty big but he was naturally with a great physique I guess the only thing you could say about him is that he hurt himself by drinking too much and did n't take very good care of himself
We got robbed in that Seattle game 	 That Russell Wilson got lucky He ca n't really pass

Much like the Raiders 	 Oh yeah What was up with that
Do you want to go see Brad Paisley with me 	 Yes I love him
Well it was a cincinnati casino show It is an outside stage but it is small so you end up super close even in the back 	 Sounds good but I would want it to be a closet small to compete with michael
That was a winner I wonder where they found that Or if it was recorded for the show 	 I do n't think it was recorded for the show I think they found and it matched
Did you like him in Schindler 's List 	 Of course I thought Ralph Fiennes played a fine role as well
Who won 	 Senators in ovetime
That 's true Lebron is the best player in the league right now and has been for awhile 	 The crazy thing is that he 's still got some good years left in him
Which song in particular you like the best from Lady Antebellum 	 I really like their latest which is You Look Good
Did you watch Pete 's Dragon 	 No What 's that about
I would say The Promise Ring 	 I could agree with that which album
Crazy What 's the plot 	 The bad guy from -LRB- Shaw -RRB- has a brother who vows vengeance on the gang
one time they fight a guy is his own house 	 really thats crazy

Yeah I just saw Guardians of the Galaxy 	 Oh it 's out already
Okay I 'll do that Is it anything like Just Dance 	 No not really It 's a newer song and her music has evolved a bit so it 's different but if you like Lady Gaga I 'm sure you 'll like this song
You 're right They did nothing to improve the situation this summer either 	 We spent a lot of time concentrating on defense and I 'm not sure it was the right move
Yeah about ten years ago It definitely was n't easy 	 Did you identify with anything in the movie
Yes A lot of it was subjective 	 That sounds pretty cool
He sure did 	 Maybe I should try listening to those songs again now that I know what they 're about
Oh nobody sees us Let 's go 	 No I feel conspicuous running aat my age
Geez that 's always hard but I have some that are always on the list 	 Like what

Tell me what was Deflategate all about 	 The Patriots were accused of underinflating balls during a playoff game
That 's right Josh Norman is on the Redskins now 	 I think Odell needs to really grow up and be a true professional Look at how Julio carries himself on the field and off the field that 's the type of leader and star wide receiver you want
I know He is still good but I do n't know how much longer than can ride that horse 	 He certainly looks like he has lost some arm strength
I just do n't know if I am sold on him 	 It just seems like more hype than proof at this point
I know what you mean me too 	 Or I could just buy digital copies
What about a light saber 	 A few of those too
Who 's the bad guy who killed Han 	 Gee I dont know Darth Maul
If he still at the top of his game the Raiders could win a lot of games next season 	 Yeah with Derek Carr and Amari Cooper they could score a lot of points
He was a nice guy A bit shy and quirky but he did n't seem like a jerk 	 A rare animal in the music industry For sure
He absolutely is molded from the Pats foundation I think he 's building something behind the scenes 	 I like his drafts too seems to put in the work to find the diamonds in the rough
Oh yeah the Navy guy 	 Yeah that 's him
Yes I imagine it would be good to see him 	 Yes it made the move more special

We got ta watch this new action movie set in china tonight 	 I know it is the hot thing
Watching Robert Downey Jr.as Tony Stark is great He 's exactly how I pictured him to be 	 I agree I do n't think anyone could do a better job than him
And his mega-hit In the Ghetto made a lot of the younger folks who had n't been big Elvis fans take notice 	 Wow i had totally forgot that song When i think of his comeback i think more of the super song Suspicious Minds
He is saying it feels great One-hundred percent and he expects to be out on the field this season 	 Have you seen him practice Does he look sluggish
I do n't really have a team but I like what the Raiders look like 	 Oh yeah They are going to be amazing I think
I love Paul Rudd 	 I completely agree I 've been a fan of him since Wet Hot American Summer
I like films with killers that could be legitimate 	 So you think the main actor was too fictitious
Moana is so cute and a great story line I mean a dangerous teen out to sea exploring all but to save her people 	 Yes I surely agree flawless what about her dad trying to teach her about her duties as this young queen but withhold her family secret
Probably only or 	 Do you prefer to watch them at home
I tend toward classical-music style soundtracks more than music-compilation soundtracks 	 That makes sense
Who Arthur 	 No Merlin He 's called Archimedes
Ok Do you think he 's ready 	 Tonight is the big game to find out
I guess this is why you should surround yourself with good people rather than yes-men 	 George needed someone to hit him over the head in the story concept stage and straighten him out Everyone would have benefited
Who do you think will end up in the finals 	 Thats easy Golden State and Cleveland
I do n't know if it was as well done though 	 Yeah I miss the old man in the first movies He was so misguided but had amazing ideas
It came out this February It 's called Drogas Light 	 Is it any good
They have to be They started in the 60s 	 I think it was actually

It 's incredible He sounds exactly like Steve Perry 	 That 's incredible Are they doing the Perry songs
No I dropped my phone 	 You missed it
Yeah that would have been hard 	 I do n't like Lorde 's new album that much
Guys like Bell and Brown really do seem to get a jolt of them 	 Speaking of which Brown is probably the best receiver in football
Yes they did I remember them singing I want to Hold Your Hand 	 Yea and All my Loving too

Yes well you need to listen to the whole album 	 Why is that
When I was watching Midnight Cowboy on TV I was thinking Dustin Hoffman always seems to be the same age He played Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy and I swear he seems to be about the same age now though he must be near 	 Yes it was so sad seeing his character die on the bus to Florida in that movie You were really rooting for him to make it
Do you really think they will even be decent this year 	 I hope so It is n't much fun rooting for a losing team
ITs not hard when they add their own elements in 	 So they dont stay true to it

I used to listen to them all the time 	 Me too and they are playing with Paula Abdul
Unfortunately the age difference was compounded when they were both adults because Amidala was so responsible and aware and Anakin was a complainy mopey baby 	 I wonder what George Lucas was thinking Here was the future Darth Vader and he needed all the positive lovable qualities he could get to make his seduction by the Dark Side all the more tragic
Let see if Toronto 's Bullpen can keep this up 	 Right We could really use another win right now

I agree They all are so similar and the plotlines are so boring 	 They will just keep making them if people keep going to them

Leonard is better than Durant and he does n't swear at mascots 	 Oh yeah I saw Durant do that
I will concede that Teenage Dream is superior to both songs but not to Blank Space Also Thinking of You was such a minor song 	 Yeah but it is her best ballad It is so much better than songs like Firework or Roar
Well he had Crabtree he had that Florida State Receiver Boldin Plus Vernon Davis was always hurt 	 Yeah that 's true I think we 're finding out that Crabtree is pretty good

I think it 's going to be live action 	 Is that right that sounds weird
Whoa that 's pretty intense Compared to Taylor 's Bad Blood this is definitely bolder 	 I would have to agree this feud they have is getting some crazy attention
The music just started to get kind of louder and faster but did n't really go anywhere after that stylistically which is also true of '90s hardcore 	 Ah I see So do you like British punk
They were thinking about money 	 Probably How did you like them though
Hi 	 Do you like Star Wars at all
Well I will admit that their Death Note movie does seem interesting 	 Yeah they have a ton of neat movies coming out like To the Bone

I love the third one 	 I did n't see that one
Well they always have to have some drama 	 What did they do to Paul Walker 's character
And it turns out that old man at the end was Rya 	 I know so deep of a movie
For a year 's supply of footballs for the NFL it takes cows 	 Holy cow holey get it

Yes I sure did it was a barn burner 	 It was back and forth every quarter
They would need to get a very young player in return who is on a long contract to ensure he stays with the Celtics for at least years 	 Even then I do n't think it 's a good move Fultz is the best prospect to come around in the last five years
Yes Every year my cousins pool their money and buy season tickets and rotate who gets them for each game 	 Cool
Have you seen the new movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them 	 Yes I did what did you think Better than Harry Potter
old classics Mr Bean things about ancient cultures 	 There is a theater on the other side of town that has matinees of old classics
They are good 	 They are way to mainstream
Right but I loved that we got a bit more back story 	 Yeah but the this reveal should have been at the end of the series plus it would have given more time for the love story to develop
So why would he be worried about a sheriff 	 The sheriff was like a former rough rider or something he used to hunt black people
You 've seen Star Wars right 	 Yes of course one of my favorite set of movies
Really I just ca n't seem to get into any of his songs 	 Yeah man I just really enjoy the comentary of his songs
His voices and personality really made that role what it was 	 Agreed without him as genie it would not have been the same movie at all

Did you finish both books 	 Not yet One of them shows how to play the rhythm part of songs that use three cords at the most That 's the one I 'm enjoying the most
Something like that as serious sounds bad 	 I mean funny would be better but it could be so bad its fun
Obviously that is not based in reality 	 Yeah so would you say Jared Leto
Oh they threw away a ton Originally Arwen was supposed to be there fighting alongside the Fellowship They had to edit around that 	 Wait what Is that why all those elves show up for no reason
I do n't think we should go back as far as the beginning of the motion photography in order to discuss what a movie is That 's just goes too far 	 Ok then how far back is necessary
I think you will like it they make funnier songs but the pace and beat of the songs are just pure genius 	 Like Weird Al

Sure 	 What is the last one you saw
That 's because they 're awesome Their songs are so unique 	 I do n't think they 're that great I saw them open for Fallout Boy once and they were okay
Still you would think they 'd want to release them closer to Halloween 	 Sure but then every horror film would be released at the same time and they 'd all drown each other out
A blaster then 	 Of course I 'll bet you 're more of a Luke kinda fellow
Yea it 's harder to relate to her songs when you 're not like years old 	 Katy Perry I feel like is more relatable though even though a lot of her songs are n't like super meaningful or deep
I really like fist fight 	 I saw that two weeks ago and it was amazing
the whole album was so danceable 	 you wont hear it in a club though
That 's what makes it sound so good 	 I agree I really like her song Touch of My Hand
Who do you like 	 I 'm a Giants fan
Well I am very interested in Rey 's storyline 	 Me too I want to see what happens with her and Luke
If anyone can do it it is him 	 Yes his exercise and diet routine allow him to live like he is

How was that 	 He had to defeat all her evil Exes
And what did you think of Leonardo DiCaprio in the Revenant 	 Nobody else could have played that role like him Survival frontiers the wilderness He embodies what his character faced
Yes the Celtics got crushed There have n't been many good games in the 2nd round 	 I know the first round was pretty good but this second round has been mainly blow out games
Me too that is what makes the story so great 	 I would have to agree
I 'm mainly into rap but I can appreciate all types of music 	 That 's great I 've given rap a little bit of a listen but I just do n't know where to start

Huh 	 For the party
I heard he could potentially miss the season because of it 	 That honestly makes me so sad
Well the remake of Old Boy was n't as good as the Korean one 	 That could be a cultural thing Like they ruined it while localizing it
I 'm just glad they 're going for it It would be so easy to mess this up out of some assumption that young men do n't want to watch a movie about a woman unless it 's all T&A 	 Yeah You know it 's I did n't see any obvious look at my ass in the trailer
Really I had not heard that 	 That was the only part that freaked me out as a kid The rest was ok though

Did he sing much with the Beatles 	 He sang some but again Paul and John got most of the attention You should listen to some of his solo work
Because I do n't think you can recreated that magic And Julie Andrews is so perfect 	 Yes she won an Oscar for it But I think the sequel will be great
Wow that sounds amazing 	 I 'm sure it will be I 've talked to my husband about trying to get out to see them in California or maybe Nevada but he 's saying we ca n't afford it
I know Eddy Brock is suppose to be pretty built 	 Sandman does n't fly

What is your favorite song 	 Rhiannon I love the melody so much
I do n't know it 's hard to say they both are good in their own way There 's a huge difference between I Want To Hold Your Hand and Let It Be 	 That 's true There was a lot of innocence in their early music
What 's it about 	 Basically the two of them are in a relationship that turns sour
Yes but I fell in love with Adele and that sunday hat she wore that was done to match her Vera Wang dress 	 Vera Wang definitely knows who will wear her dresses to impress
Well nowadays you can get audiophile quality sound for less money If you have a computer and are willing to spend about dollars you can get a sound setup that is remarkably good 	 No kidding What about the quality of the music or the recordings
Perfect I keep hearing Despacito on the radio so I 'll add that one too 	 I love that song It 's such a good rhythm I ca n't help dancing when I hear it

What do you like about it 	 I like Rey
Definitely I wanted to see more of her after Batman vs Superman and I still want to see her in another solo Wonder Woman movie 	 Do you think Wonder Woman will have a sequel
We shall see nothing we can really do to prevent that 	 I just think this is finally our season I am tired of watching a build up and then fall off from the Raiders
You would think he would have been conscious while on the shelf and realize that he was not a space man 	 Toys in the store were alive
It would be pretty awesome 	 Well they might do one some day you never know
I 'm not sure why they did n't expose Wormtail 	 Maybe they were trying to act like they did n't know about Voldemort 's rise
The 's man Every genre was great back then 	 I kind of like the music of today better
All new music has to have some attractive singer 	 Kurt Cobain was considered attractive

I like baseball sure 	 Yeah same here

That 's cool Have I heard any of their songs 	 Probably They are played on the radio quite a bit and they have had some songs on movie soundtracks
I went to a party this weekend and the host was playing a bunch of Taylor Swift to celebrate her being back on Spotify 	 That sounds like a strange party Most of the parties I go to play pop or hip hop
Tough to say since there are so many great players 	 You have to your eye on someone who you think has a chance
Next Month The 14th 	 Where is it
Do you have a favorite female rapper 	 Iggy Azalea is my favorite
I did n't know Norwegian wood was the wood John was burning in a girls fireplace when they were in Norway 	 I know still learning things about the Beatles I never knew before
How are they now 	 They still hurt And I have rotator cuff issues You
That 's strange What did they change them to 	 They changed Pip 's name to Finn and Miss Havisham to Mrs. Dinsmoor
I do not think many did He has been off his game for the last decade or so since Little Nicky 	 You did not see Grown Ups two

Not entirely no 	 So who do you really like then What artists are your favorite
Me too I 'm so glad they 're still making music years later 	 I hope they never stop

You know who was my favorite character It was Crush the sea turtle 	 I know right He had like a cool surfer dude personality I loved it
I am literally going to cry if Optimus Prime kills Bumblebee that would be so stupid 	 Another thing I like about the Transformer movies is all the cool new cars they always feature
Tell me about it He towers over everyone on the field 	 I think he lost a lot of his nerve when he saw Stanton was n't dropping his bat though
Something like that you know the Warriors will crush the Cavs in the playoffs 	 Just like they did last year

I agree not much dialogue wise for her but she pulled her weight and was able to emote so well no words were needed to feel her emotions 	 Exactly and to have that skill and power at such a young age is so impressive to me
Right And they are loving it 	 I 'm so glad I think it is such a wonderful message
Man Ozzy Smith was a beast on RBI baseball 	 I loved RBI baseball Good times
Its not to bad They just have to finish out games strong 	 Well the D is solid at least

Did you know that Lin Manuel Miranda wrote a lot of the music for Moana 	 Of Hamilton fame No way
Yes I 've been to a game at Hard Rock Stadium and it almost felt more like a social event than a football game 	 Miami has some pretty good player on their roster though That 's something for their fans to get excited about
It has a political theme Something to really make you think 	 So it makes you reflect on current events
No Definitely no They 've been a trainwreck 	 That bad
Yeah he plays um several of the lead roles 	 That 's odd
Me too it was dark but I think that was the best movie he has ever made 	 Yeah a lot of his other movies are about him being good looking and smooth
Thats cool 	 I loved them

Absolutely Seeing a game in person is much better than on the TV 	 Really why
The first one I thought was more well done than the third it definitely has a surprise ending but I thought Cube was the scariest 	 Really
Iron Man 	 The first one

Yeah they played in Liverpool and Hamburg in the early 's 	 I think they got real popular around
She was jealous of Whitney being a star and really hated her own sister 	 They had a funeral for the sister Not much came out about the plot They tried to get her again at an award ceremony
It was great I highly recommend it 	 I thought it might be I 've heard it 's a classic
You do have to admit the best scene was the popcorn scene 	 Yes I could n't believe that anyone could make such a huge ball of corn kernels
Yeah they got Greinke last year Looks like he 's settled in nicely 	 Too bad it took a whole season before this Diamondbacks bullpen in general seems improved
It was played at a wedding I attended recently 	 Really It that song is classic I want to buy a record now
Because he 's so cool 	 Fine man But will you quit complaining
You 're right I remember that He was acquitted though 	 Yep I watched part of the trial
Really I hope it 's true 	 Those guys are too old for that kind of action if you ask me

Why do you say that 	 It is what started it all for M. Night

What is your favorite kind of music 	 I kind of like everything Well except heavy metal and most rap I guess
Did you notice that big bracelet she had on 	 Yeah I was wondering if it was real
Yeah but who is gon na start for them 	 I would assume Trevor Siemian again
Yeah I actually did n't really get into them until the last few years 	 That 's pretty crazy
Then why do you listen to their music 	 Most of the religious stuff is secondar to the meanings I impart from it
I bet you could get plenty done with that on though 	 You think so
blah blah gooby do 	 I 'm sorry I did n't quite catch that I think Raffi is rotting your brain You should try something else
I cant imagine it sounds good 	 I mean yeah some of the themes are sad

My children fall asleep singing Do you want to build a snowman 	 And I hear Let It Go all day
There are still examples of college teams winning exhibition games against pro teams Granted those teams are frequently made up of minor league players 	 The MLB team would be favored in each game but the odds would probably be against them going or whatever the total number of games would be for a season
Well given the way they traded and drafted I am I 'm just saying I do n't see any NFC contenders that will be better 	 I think this is the Eagles year

I think it may have been my favorite out of all the movies 	 It is close for me with the original Not sure which one I liked better
So Sneezy and Dopey were not dignified 	 I guess not But they have sure been glorified Have you seen the outside of the Disney building The dwarfs are featured sculptures

Well I mean why did that one bad guy had a cross guard on his lightsaber Seems like that be rather worthless 	 Well it 's not explained in the film but actually it 's because the crystal he used to make his lightsaber was cracked and that caused a flaw in it 's design Guessing he just kind of made it work rather than trying it again
Any particular reason 	 I think because it had a dark tone and a non happy ending

I went to see Metallica at Stadium Negara when I was in Malaysia 	 Wow what was it like seeing them in a foreign country
That 's not even a question is it It 's obviously Star Wars 	 Okay maybe so but I 'd argue that the public knows just as many Lord of the Ring characters as they do Star Wars
Also the dance sequences in Moulin Rouge are great ESPECIALLY the Roxanne number 	 That is a good routine
That was fun but that 's probably the best part of the whole movie 	 You can say what you want but that movie was great and it had all my favorite characters
That is a good one I love the genie and friend like me 	 Robbins Williams was great in that role
Yes Gedde Watanabe played his character I love when he comes down from the bed and scares Molly Ringwald 	 He says What 's Happenin Hot Stuff So so funny

Yeah it was a pretty good movie I actually want to watch it again 	 You just saw that why would you want to see it again
I think they play Bad and Boujee way too much 	 I agree Just like Future and his song Mask Off

So who should they take A point guard 	 They need shooting They should take the best shooter available which is Malik Monk
Not really it has become more about making money for the owners than serving the fans 	 Why do you think that

Who is the current quarteback for Miami 	 Matt Moore is the current quarterback
My favorite scene was in the 7th movie I think when he was talking to Rome and Rome was telling him how rare his car was 	 Then Tej walked outside and he had the same exact one

Where did he play college football 	 Temple where he had an outstanding record
How do you think Romo will do in broadcasting since he 's now retired 	 I think he will do great

Oh yes I 've seen that Is she Sandy 	 Yes she played Sandy
Yeah like who 	 Ryan Leaf He was drafted 2nd overall by the chargers in

Hmm I might start to like this band more now 	 How What 's getting you into this
My favorite is star wars 	 I love star wars
My brother did so I listened to a lot of the songs when I was younger 	 What was your favorite Jackson song
Yes they do 	 I appreciate your recommendation my friend
We can always go to Ticketmaster and find out 	 Let 's try to get seats close to the stage
It was pretty neat to see them and got fairly close too 	 Where in Florida
One of the best scenes was the fight scene at the end 	 Yeah that was pretty cool

Me too 	 No
The Fantastic Beasts one 	 Yes it has a lot of potential to be amazing
I 've never heard of one 	 It 's documented
Yea but they lost Marshawn Lynch and just did n't have the same pop 	 Yea I agree to some extent but they still have an amazing defense
HE IS A DEFENSIVE COACH AND THE BRONCOS HAVE A GOOD DEFENSE 	 I AGREE BUT IS HE A BETTER DEFENSIVE COACH THAN WADE PHILLIPS
The Colts were pretty good for the next or so years 	 True but the Colts never had a great defense
yes what about some of his best songs 	 I would have to say sussidio
I do n't like a lot of their music anyways 	 Me neither but some of it is good

That is an oldie is n't it Who was in that one 	 Cary Grant and Grace Kelly stared in it It was from the golden age of movies but I would love to see a new spin on it

That is what i am hoping 	 Well it might happen
Yes but I liked the new characters too 	 The new characters were awesome Kylo Ren had an inner struggle between the Force and the Dark Side
Do you think there going to win the Championship this year 	 I hope so that would be cool being thats my hometown
He 's barely a hero too He 's kind of a jerk the whole film and it 's too silly 	 Plus the focus is on the mask If Iron Man was all about the armor or if they did a movie entirely on Thor 's hammer then it would be the same
The characters were not relatable 	 Like who
That does n't decrease the heartache 	 I 'm just saying one is unexpected the other is not necessarily so
Yeah I 've seen a few so far 	 What 's been the best one you 've seen this summer
I tought it was good at first but after researching your picks could all be big or bust type players 	 Yeah that is a bit worrisome to me
There were a lot of villains and Tobey 's character spoke to me 	 You were emo that 's right
We all are Reboots too 	 This one was actually a decent movie and true to the source material
But are n't they moving to Vegas anyway 	 Yes but they 'll still be in Oakland next season
It may be longer than that the stadium in Vegas has ran into issues off and on in terms of investors and building it 	 It seems like they would need to build it away from the strip since that is already pretty clogged up
StubHub sent me last years playoff tickets 	 Contact the stadium and see if they can verify that the ticket number is last year 's
Rams are in the last meetings I do n't know how to explain it 	 Jeff Fisher 's superbowl was the good team -LRB- s -RRB- in the NFC West

Three pets trying to find their family 	 Is it animated
It can be better but it does have many play makers 	 Such as

He 's one of mine too 	 Awesome movie Really funny yet really sad
What do you think the steelers will do 	 I think they will have a good year
We 'll see how they do at draft 	 Ugh I get so intense watching the draft it 's nerve wrecking
No the third one is really bad Just pretend that it does n't exist 	 What 's so great about the Godfather movies
Maybe but the Bulls also had playoff Rondo who was playing out of his mind 	 True but the the argument is if Wall is really a top point guard and based on what you said he falls into the Rondo category
I saw a cute story online about Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters 	 I love Foo Fighters What happened
Yeah I really like You 've got a friend in me 	 Oh yeah that 's a great song
Well his era was 3rd worst in the nl when he was sent to the bullpen 	 I do n't know not sure you could say it 's been THAT bad
Yes he did 	 I remember all the stuffed Pooh Bears in your house
Why 	 Well first I have glasses so it makes it tough to watch them Besides that I just do n't think it adds that much to the movie
Ya huey lewis was totally ripped off in ghostbusters 	 Interesting He was asked to write the music for ghostbusters but was busy with other work
Weeks Later 	 Oh come on There were n't any zombies in that movie
Rocky How do we even narrow down the top there are so many 	 Its silly to even have to say this but Star wars
Those were n't bad but they just were n't like the originals I know that most people prefer Empire but I 'll always be a big fan of Return of the Jedi 	 Really what do you like most about it
What Disney film can you not live without 	 The Little Mermaid
I think he was one of the best rappers line for line of his era 	 I agree he was very good at his time
Maybe with enough time 	 Yeah maybe
That 's such a throwback It could be good though 	 Yeah And then maybe something you guys can get really into
I love when they were drinking the syrup 	 Yeah that was gross but good
I believe it was Hitman 	 Really You have not seen anything after that
When did it come out 	 I 'm not sure before I was born
Yes he did and the crowd went nuts 	 I bet I would love to see him
I think this could all get pretty messy 	 Just because it could potentially be messy does n't mean it would n't be worth it
You mean they sing that one song No Diggity right 	 Yes That was really popular back then
I cried when everyone died 	 Me too I do n't know how they could possibly make a sequel
Oh Papparazi off that album is my favorite 	 I will say though that I am glad she 's done with the theatrics
Yes it is but his music lives on forever 	 I play his stuff a lot
The Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots 	 Why
Oh you do n't like horror 	 No not really
What was his band called 	 Hootie and The Blowfish
Okay I 'll have to listen to them sometime 	 Definitely Are there any other metal bands you 're into
They are I guess I just never really watched much rugby 	 I 'm from Australia so we do n't really watch NFL much Rugby is our thing since we were kids
Ok Fine whatever 	 Let 's see the player with the most points over career is Karem Abdul Jabbar but that 's a bad metric
Yeah except Harrison Ford played a whole lot older Indiana Jones than he did play a young Luke Skywalker 	 I like how George Lucas uses android robots in his Star Wars series
You ever play 	 I only played when I was a kid
Their new song is amazing its so empowering 	 I know it makes me want to go out and chase my dreams
You 'll have to watch it to find out 	 I am so curious now I 'll rent it tonight
You 're right I 'm really looking forward to going since we do n't get to go very often and I know our Mom 's will enjoy going to see a baseball game in person 	 Me too plus they are giving away sun hats for Mother 's Day for all of the Mom 's so that will be nice for them to wear while watching the game in the sun
It 's not They have Reyes 	 Reyes is n't reliable
But he 's not very fast 	 He 's plenty fast enough Look at how many touchdowns he scores
Country was huge in the 90s There were country bars on every corner 	 Line dancing was the thing to do then
Who is this 	 Wagner
Most musicians are self taught so I am not sure if it is that important for the teacher to be good 	 Do you think the use of drugs by some musicians increases their artistic creativity
Well then show me some facts 	 Just google it man
The broncos 	 Why
Seems interesting 	 I concur but I think it is rather odd they are remaking it
I like most of his movies but this is his best 	 Is Bogart a good guy or a bad guy
Are you into hard rock 	 No but this song is n't all that hard It 's just hard enough for me
Definitely have someone watch it with you that likes comedy 	 Will do and I will make some mood munchies for the best experience
It 's about the guy from Re-animator the act or Jeffrey Combs not the character 	 What does he do
Yeah I remember that part too 	 I remember he was a good dog
Yeah and he started on a soap opera 	 Really which one
I see what you 're saying 	 I highly doubt employers will make any changes
They 're not too long either I think each one is about an hour and a half 	 That 's not too bad
Oh you will Charlie Day is always hilarious 	 He really is
I would love to meet her in real life 	 You ca n't Its fiction
We 'll have to see how that pans out for them 	 Yeah give them two or three more years before you proclaim judgment
Yes when it 's true it 's seems to be better 	 Yes if it 's done well
New England 	 Was Tom Brady involved
I guess what I 'm trying to say is that Wu are better because of their longevity 	 I can understand that but I feel like impact and influence outweigh longevity by a lot
Yeah it sounds kind of biblical in a way and for a big guy like that to command respect is definitely a plus 	 The 49ers defense needs to win back people 's respect and they probably could n't do that with a bunch of players named Taco and Budda
It was truly an emotional and touching farewell 	 I liked that Dom named his new baby after Brian in the latest movie
Poor Ringo never gets any recognition 	 Haha yeah he was alright more there for personality I think
Yeah absolutely 	 Do you have a favorite

It 's hard to pick a favorite 	 I know what you mean there so many to chose from
Me too How do you feel about seeing a thriller movie 	 I love thriller movies The last one that I saw was Do n't Breathe
I 'm a NY Jets fan but they released most of their players 	 Oh yeah I heard Eric Decker left
Yes and his last cd was a bit depressing 	 I guess because he knew he was going to die
I might do that Where do they play 	 Juli does n't do much except special events these days but Sarah plays regularly at a jazz club downtown Suzanna is playing around Texas and Oklahoma right now
What was it 	 I do not really remember but it was very sad
Yes Aileen Wornos the prostitute who became a killer 	 Was n't Christina Ricci in that too
How many volumes were there 	 Uma Thurman won a couple awards for her role
Yeah I saw it when it was in the theater 	 What did you think
No I did n't was it any good 	 What did you think of the Star Wars movie
Hopefully they make it hard for them THIS season 	 That would be nice
I would argue with you that The Phantom Menace -LRB- -RRB- II Attack of the Clones -LRB- -RRB- III and Revenge of the Sith -LRB- -RRB- IV were not enjoyable at all 	 Matter of opinion my friend Yes the actors playing Anakin were all wooden and lame but we were able to see the Jedi council and learn about the birth of the Empire
Really but was n't that the season they came back and won the Superbowl again 	 Yeah they beat the Falcons After all that they were still the best team to win the Superbowl
Micheal slang cocaine 	 Her dresses where pretty

They were good And the acting was good too 	 Yeah the boy that starred in it did really well
I really like Obi wan in the prequels he is very well done in my opinion 	 Yes i quite like him in the prequels as well One of the things they did right i like Ewan Mcregor for that role
Who was your favorite 	 Back in the day I guess New Kids on the Block
You have to take out a small loan for to buy tickets and then if you want snacks your kids can no longer go to college Seriously it is just too expensive when movies at home are cheap and more convenient 	 And your second reason
Exactly And Kemp 	 He was a good player once
What 's your favorite album 	 I love the first album most of all The one with the song Clint Eastwood and Rock the House
And is part of the title of And Justice for All Got it 	 Got it Should I listen in any certain order
What kind of music does your band play 	 We 're a progressive rock band Somewhere in between Pink Floyd and the Red Hot Chili Peppers
It 's a good song 	 I do really like Easton corbin though
Oh cool 	 Yeah my favorite player is Tim Williams
Oh yeah 	 Yup It 's based on a true story
I guess Maui would be my favorite 	 And who is he played by
It is their first album 	 Ok that is special
That 's exactly it Those moments are pretty good and suspenseful but I had to give a thumbs down at the end I was n't happy with it at all 	 Did it get too cheesy
Never heard of her what 's she sing 	 She 's not very popular so not many people have heard of her country folk music
Hey 	 Do you think want to talk about fashion
Do you think the Penguins will eventually win the best of seven 	 They are certainly capable of it
DID YOU SEE THEM AT A CONCERT 	 YES IT WAS A LOTS OF PEOPLES THERE
Yeah he raps about life in the streets and how its real 	 Man that does sound deep
What type of movie is it 	 More drama but definitely some fantasy elements About an older man basically reliving his life through tall tales
Green day Dookie 	 wow great first purchase
The part with her head spinning around is scary 	 It is scary because demons exist
Yeah if they could have added another star it could 've made a difference 	 But for now they are over matched and overwhelmed
Maybe I just have n't heard them 	 There are so many I 've been listening to lately
Oh yeah it looks really awesome and funny to cause there 's a part in the trailer where he 's kicking butt and they 're playing Queen 's Do n't Stop Me Now 	 Ha I remember when they had that on Shawn of the Dead while they 're beating that one zombie down with pool sticks
Yes but I want to at least see a potential Superbowl team play 	 I understand so Rams versus Seahawks it is
Right so maybe this year will be the year the whole team actually makes it past the 1st playoff game 	 I hope so
With Cumberbatch 	 Yeah

Uh the first thing that comes to mind is Titanic 	 You 're awful Titanic Really

That 's my second favorite song 	 Wait what 's your favorite

The acting was really good 	 I liked the setting and the story

O.K. I definitely will not say the name of the team that has Tom Brady as its quarterback and that is the team the Steelers must be able to beat 	 Good I do n't want to hear it And anyways this is the year that the Steelers D learns how to shut them down Hard

What is second on your list 	 I 've always enjoyed his performance in Magnolia
That one is beautiful as well I sang that in a concert one year 	 I think my son 's class did too a couple years ago

True 	 This was right after the civil rights movement
Strawberry fields 	 Eleanour Rigby used to really depress me

Did you like the other movies 	 I liked the other ones I thought they were pretty funny and watched them with my little brother
That maybe a choice they make they ca n't get rid of him though because his contract is good for another year 	 I guess you will just have to wait and see what the Bucs want to do with Aguayo for the season
Yes there might have been a few mild curse words and maybe some language that was a bit sexual but nothing really bad 	 So would you take your younger children to see it
They build up the tension throughout this movie about the shark Just how big is he But they show very little of him 	 Then what 's the movie about
Finding Nemo was a great Disney movie do n't you think 	 Yes all of the tropical fish were so vibrant and colourful
Oh okay 	 What about you
Okay i will have to get things ready 	 Okay cool
Probably as their motivations would be more or less the same They want to restore the Republic but the difference is they 're restoring it from an outside takeover rather than an internal transformation 	 And the Jedi No Order so they would n't be wiped out

Have you ever seen Blow 	 No What 's that

Oh me neither but I heard it will make you cry 	 I heard the same thing Finding Nemo definitely did
I saw the most awesome horror movie the other day 	 Really what was it called
Yes he was awesome I did n't think anyone could stand up to Sir Alec Guinness but he did the job 	 Great tie in Rey turns out to be Kenobi 's grand daughter and the Obi-Wan movie is about keeping an eye on her
Well bon scott is good but not the only 	 Hah i beg to differ
I like movies that are based on a true story 	 Yes this one tells quite the tale
Did n't Anna Kendrick voice one of the characters 	 The girl from Pitch Perfect I did n't know that
I have my personal favorites but I wouldnt say one is best of all time 	 So then what do you think is your favorite album of all time

I hardly remember that movie it was so long ago that I saw it 	 I would see it again
I wonder how much of his stunt work Johnny Depp actually does 	 No idea but I do know that he or Disney said this would probably be the last movie in the series.I 'm not sure I buy that
not sure I would like electronic music 	 No it 's not electronic It 's more alternative rock but they do use electronic type equipment for some of their music
That was a classic Judd Nelson was hysterical and Ally Sheedy really did a great job on her character 	 I read that Ally Sheedy was having trouble playing her part at first but got really into it as the filming went on
they where a good group folks still love their tunes 	 everytime i turn on the radio there on it
Do you like 's music 	 Yes
Anyways what makes you like them 	 Well for one thing I like how they use their harmonies together And they sound like they have so much fun singing together
Do you like any other songs by Pitbull 	 Well I really liked that one that he sang with that Ke ha girl
I like almost everything too but mostly pop and electronic 	 There have been a lot of pop and electronic artists collaborations lately What 's your favorite
Yes and has so many good movies 	 Another movie of his I like is As Good as it Gets
With Lynch Carr and Cooper they arguably might have the best triple player offence in the league 	 Brown Bell and Roethlisburger from the Steelers might argue that
Those are greats too Did you like Tupac 	 Yes I had forgotten about him But of course
I remember New Edition with Bobby Brown They did like five or six songs 	 Man I remember that like it was yesterday
But couldnt do much until he got the big three 	 Listen hes a good coach and wont let the team sink
THANKS 	 ANYTIME BUDDY LISTEN LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THEM I 'LL COME ON BY AND LISTEN WITH YOU
Wow that sounds pretty intense 	 Yes it is You should watch it
Which one 	 The Girl with All the Gifts It has an rating on Rotten Tomatoes and Roger Ebert gave it stars
What When did that happen 	 He has a song called Not Afraid where he tells all of his fans how thankful he is for them and tells them that he vows to break that dangerous lifestyle
Me too 	 Its definitely the best sport
But you ca n't be in the spotlight forever 	 They should have managers who tell them this
Well let 's see who wins tomorrow then shall we 	 The game is about to come on Are you going to watch
He 's pretty good I like him 	 I hate to say it but if Tony Romo had n't got hurt we would never have known how good he is
Right 	 It just did n't fit
Is n't Stevie Nicks the greatest 	 Yes she is and her voice is amazing She 's a real witch you know
I mean I love Radiohead but I really loved their bit in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire 	 Wait they were in Goblet of Fire
Yeah I do n't know if I 'll root for them I 'll probably watch a few games 	 Well it 's basically the same team Rivers Gates and crew
I know I 'm just saying 	 What music do you like other than Pilots
Probably like eight or so of us depending 	 A good sized group
No I heard it was not that good 	 Yeah it had some pretty bad reviews But Wonder Woman was in that movie too
Yes We had three generations go to the concert 	 And everyone enjoyed it
It was because you feel like you have to watch all of them 	 And they are all great
Wow thats great that we agree 	 Yeah it had so much great dialogue
I did not see it 	 Neither did I but we all know it was out

Movies have no substance anymore Who 's the actress playing her mom 	 Goldie Hawn
What is your favorite CCR song 	 Bad Moon Rising
I think they really need to work on their television production 	 What do you mean
Really My neice loves it she is 	 I guess it appeals to some of this millenial generation
You 'll really like it It 's a Coming of Age movie too but a darker one Shailenes really good in it 	 There have been so many good Coming of Age movies recently Short Term with Brie Larson I would even say Room is somewhat of that too
Yeah me too Was n't that one of his first 	 I do n't know but it was one of the first I heard
Donald Glover He is in Comuunity and Atlanta 	 Maybe I would if I saw him What about him
Brad Pitt is at his funniest in this film 	 Is that a fact
Plus the original cast made cameos 	 Maybe
I like more modern movies 	 It just does n't seem like newer movies these days have good stories
Right they had the Mars side and the Jupiter side 	 I remember the Jupiter side being a little more mellow than Mars
I do indeed I 'm partial towards something like I want to hold your hand 	 See that 's where we differ I get bored sometimes with their more traditional stuff
Yea can you tell those teams that 	 Yea especially Houston I mean I guess they tried and struck out with Osweiler did n't they
Cuba Gooding Jr was in that too right 	 Yea he was n't a lead but yes he was
Gosh that 's a no brainer I love Britney Spears music 	 Yeah her music is definitely great but I like Christina better as a person
Yes We Do n't Run 	 He also does a lot to help poverty
No he died during the filming of Fast and Furious so they just did not include him or Jordanna Brewster who plays Mia 	 Is Fast just as good as the rest
I do n't know last year your Patriots won by scoring points 	 True but they also shut out the Falcons in the second half of the super bowl
Whats your favorite album 	 I like their self titled album best
Think how many people he has entertained over the years 	 I ca n't wait to see in a few years what kind of celebration they have for the year anniversary
I had a blast watching it It was creepy and gory 	 I guess it is a good thing you do n't have a fear of clowns
Oh ok Well it 's been a while since their last album 	 It has been a while since I do n't really know how music is working these days now
I 'm with you I really like that band 	 I liked their ealiest stuff best
It is tearing up the country charts now 	 Awesome That was one of my favorite songs of his and his group
No I think he does deserve to be on the singers list listen to Georgia 	 Elton John too
Hey man did you check out that Warriors vs Spurs game earlier today 	 I sure did it was game of the Western Conference Finals and that crowd was going crazy
Well I liked Death Magnetic but have been lukewarm on the rest of them 	 Did you hear that album they put out with Lou Reed
Yeah just shows how crazy it is to be a consistent team 	 Well getting back to the Seahawks I think they are reloading for another run right now
I mean this genre was created during the 70s and it was only popular in the UK back then 	 Well us Americans ai n't gon na listen much to that crap load of music
Yeah I guess you 're right he has n't produced an album for a long time 	 Yeah so long I do n't even remember his last album
Oh that is superb movie 	 What else do you know
I do n't know But making mix tapes are fun because you can also add your own vocalizations much more easily than with a CD 	 I do n't even have any burnable CDs anymore I mainly listen to music on my phone
I love when he sings the song Under the Sea to convince Ariel about how great the ocean is 	 That is the best song in the movie
But their songs from the 70s were not that bad either 	 Yeah they were true classic rock
Actually the only song I liked of hers was work 	 Wow that is like
No.Dez seems to have settled down There age difference is small.As much as I like Odell 's talent I would keep Dez 	 I like that the Cowboys drafted Ryan Switzer Do you think he will replace Beasley
What makes those songs so good 	 I really enjoy the emotion and harmony they put into their songs
What do you mean 	 They 're were playing this one song where the guy is mentioning suicide and stuff and I 'm like Whoa is this the same band that song I Wan na Hold Your Hand and Let It Be and all those
What 's your favorite New Edition song 	 When Will I See You Smile Again That 's a classic
Who directed that one 	 Joss Whedon directed it
I saw the Eagles in Concert in Clevleland back in the 's It was awesome 	 What 's your favorite Eagles song

She kind of went MIA after that 	 Yea totally would n't you though
You 're a fan 	 Oh the biggest That band reminds me of my college days so much
Yeah and the people are traveling together 	 To some kind of fun park in California right
Old 	 Led Zeppelin is great
No I have n't what are they like 	 It 's a grunge band from the 90s I really like their music
Yes definitely Portraying an actual historical figure is always tough to pull off 	 Do you think going forwards he 's going to do more roles like Doctor Strange like more blockbuster type movies
Did you ever see The Accountant 	 Was n't that the movie that came out with Ben Affleck
Have you ever seen The Stepford Wives 	 The original one or the newer one
I did n't see it when it was out only years later They both look so young 	 Did you see Edward scissor hands of Sweeney Todd
Yes i play it all the time 	 I love listening to it
Well now I ca n't wait until Thor Ragnarok 	 I know Me too
I liked the original spiderman 	 With Toby Maguire
Who won 	 San Francisco
Two sisters Kate and Lisa and go to Mexico for a vacation filled with sun fun and adventure 	 Let me guess They get themselves in the water and attacked by some sharks
That 's a great movie I cried when she said to Hugh Grant I 'm just a girl standing here asking a boy to love her Makes me cry every time 	 Another good team for romantic comedies is Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler
Did n't Jay Z sing that song with her 	 You 're right I think he did
Hmm I think either Be Prepared or I Just Ca n't Wait To Be King 	 Yes that 's a really tough decision But I really liked Hakuna Matata
Do you like Public Enemy 	 The are the greatest Flavor Flav is the man
I 'd love to have the Witch 's powers but I 'd like to be able to control them myself 	 Good choice I would like to have the Diablo 's powers to manipulate fire
It stars Meryl Streep and Amy Adams as nuns Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a new priest Father Flynn 	 I think I may have seen that Des n't Meryl Streep not like Father Flynn because she thinks he is too nice
That is a Japanese composer named Motoi Sakuraba 	 Wow what style of music is that
Another favorite is called Stressed Out 	 That one is definitely good the words just fit life
Are they playing games in London again 	 I believe so Jacksonsville somehow always gets stuck playing over there
What kind of films would you suggest to me Obviously I 've seen The Birds already 	 There are so many out there A few of my personal recommendations include Psycho Dial M for Murder and The Man Who Knew Too Much
You did n't like his turn in the Wicker Man 	 Haha nah I did n't really like the original Wicker Man either I thought it was too slow and dull
I love Hunky Dory I think Ziggy is still my favorite 	 Ziggy 's classic It 's amazing how much good music he produced in the 70s
That 's awesome I have to see them 	 Wait but they 're not videos of new songs it is just him talking and making jokes
He was a quarterback mainly known for the New York Jets although he ended his career playing for the Los Angeles Rams 	 What was the commercial for
I think you might be doing it wrong 	 How can i do that
One could only wish He sings it so beautifully 	 The lyrics and melody make me want to cry it 's just so good
Do you listen to hip-hop or rap music 	 Really I do n't very much I 'm not a huge fan
Me too what is you favorite I Love Desert Fury with Elizabeth Scott but I also like really trashy 's movies like Peyton Place 	 Oh wow me too I have this awesome movie that was one of Suzanne Pleshette 's first movies called A Rage To Live have you seen that
Hi what kind of movies do you like 	 Superhero movies
Listen to the new album Relaxer 	 Is it good
This is a controversial answer but I loved the final battle in Attack of the Clones 	 You 're right it is controversial What about it did you like
Not to much 	 That 's good
The entire Imperium Internum album is pretty intense highly recommended if you like that sort of thing 	 I 'm guessing Black Goat of the Woods is sort of a Lovecraft type of thing
Sort of but they 're not completely a true New Wave group Though I suppose they could n't be since to be a New Wave group you kind of had to be there at the time 	 You 're probably right I guess they 're more of an electric-rock group or something along those lines anyhow
He 's a great running back and they need to just keep giving him the ball 	 Who is Dallas 's best wide receiver right now
Are you kidding me the Rockets just let him the hog the ball every possession It 's easy to get stats like that 	 You are crazy trying to tell me that Harden is n't the MVP because he 's a ball hog then turn around and say the ultimate ball hog Westbrook is the MVP
So it 's a romance movie 	 It is but it also has some mystery in it It 's a very beautiful movie plot and animation wise
have you heard any word on who might be starting this year for the Dallas cowboys 	 Well i heard Tony Romo was quitting and gon na try his hand at coaching
Well you ca n't beat the casts in both of them Gene Wilder Madeline Kahn Marty Feldman Teri Garr they 're all great 	 Oh the best I love Harvey Korman too I thought he was so terrific in Blazing Saddles
Who beat them in the Super Bowl that year 	 It was the Buffalo Bills They did n't even deserve to be in the Super Bowl but they somehow beat the Dolphins
Do you think Boba Fett died too easily in Return of the Jedi 	 Yes definitely He is supposed to be the most dangerous Bounty Hunter in the galaxy
Wow I wonder if bodies can handle football at such young ages 	 Well a big topic is concussions
That would be a trip but do you people would remember it 	 I 'm not sure but it would be such a treat for fans
I must be too old to enjoy them Ha ha 	 I do it 's impressive that there are only two members of the band
I truly have no idea 	 I am also not too fond of rap
I used to have that one it 's still a good CD 	 I always wanted it but I could n't afford it when it came out
I hope the rest of this series is n't like this although I would be happy if they won if every game is like this 	 I hear what you mean That was some brutal hockey
What was it about 	 Basically about some young adults who break into a blind man 's house but do n't expect what happens next
I 've always enjoyed his performance in Magnolia 	 That was a great film His character was pretty interesting
I know I 've been there before when it was pretty darn cold Went one time when the Giants were playing the Eagles It was like degrees 	 I 've been there in the snow before Great games That 's when they play the best too
She and Dan Stevens Luke Evans Kevin Kline all did spectacular work on the film 	 Ok you 've convinced me I will see it this weekend and if they 're lucky maybe I 'll take the kids
They have a song they perform with Kirk Franklin called Perfect People 	 What 's so modern about that
Redbone is the stand out track on the album but it 's not my favorite 	 Which one is your favorite track
Well you have to look at the guys who made the top players Ezekiel Elliot is probably number one 	 I can agree with that I do n't think their rankings are exactly accurate though
I don t think so but she did on the television 	 Cool Maybe we could listen to their album if you will listen to a Rod Stewart album
Really 	 I wo n't tell you any details but you wo n't guess what happens
I dont think he wanted to do it more 	 And became more into the business side
Why did you choose that movie 	 I liked this movie because there was action but it also made you think alot
Oh yeah he was on probably one of the worst teams I can ever remember Jim Miller was the QB 	 Yeah it was kinda silly The Packers swept the Bears that year and went themselves but did n't even win the division
Do you remember the movie Holes 	 I remember the name but not what it was about
Was there anything good about the movie 	 Well it was silly and did not really teach any lessons which my kids loved but I like when there 's a greater message
It 's an older stop motion animation movie from the 90s 	 Oh I did n't realize it 's been out a long time What happens in it
The Cowboys Really Are n't they all rookies 	 Yeah they are a young team but they have some real talent
So you have n't told me what is is about 	 It 's a sad story this poor lady dies and her employer rises her child as his because he was afraid they catch him -LRB- because he was an ex-convict -RRB- sad but beautiful at the same time
I liked it too It had a slightly more dark tone than the main series 	 It was definitely grittier than other Star Wars movies
I think that Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup did a really great job 	 Yea it really takes the right actors to make that movie great
As in the same way they did with Brian 's character 	 Yeah Just write them into normal lives
I do n't think so Billy Dee Williams does n't do much acting anymore 	 True true so any other theories
I like when he is yelling at his ball to go in the hole 	 That is also a very funny part
Kurt Cobain was amazing 	 Agreed sad about him gone way too soon
That 's a good one but I really like When We Were Young 	 I like it too But I think I prefer when she 's more upbeat because we do n't hear it often
I sure hope so Tony is hilarious 	 I wonder if any of the other avengers will be in it
What did you like about that 	 It was funny when the banker picked up the gold coin
I dont really know things are tough since lynch has going to the Raiders 	 How dumb is it that they are going to Vegas
I do too And the pumpkin tranformation 	 Oh the best
I thought it was good 	 Well I do n't think it was terrible I just thought they could have done so much more
I dont know how much a leading man Alec Baldwin is 	 He certainly has pigeon holed himself into comedy
I agree But with Tony Stark in this there 's no way it 'll be bad 	 I sure hope so Tony is hilarious
Yes but they play the music at too high of a volume 	 Is it at least music that you like
Me to how about we listen to some music 	 That sounds fun but we should listen to something a little different
I watched Hacksaw Ridge a couple of weeks ago 	 Really How was it
I love those guys 	 Me too tobey maguire and cameron diaz are in it too
What do you listen to 	 I like country and pop
Thats what I like 	 Yea its a really good song
Do you think want to talk about fashion 	 Sure I love fashion what 's your favorite thing to wear
You might as well go ahead and play that Motown Philly Do you have the extended version 	 You better know it I 'm going to put that thing on right now
You only have to pay if you want to get the ad-free version 	 Oh yeah I heard about that It 's probably worth paying for that
Thats not what you asked me 	 You are right I think the best is All You Need is Love
Well I did just buy a new 3D TV Why do n't you come over this weekend 	 Awesome I 'll be there Saturday night
Usher used to make all the ladies swoon 	 Yes he did
Me too ca n't wait 	 Well best of luck
So did I 	 It took a long time to delete it from my phone
Absolutely they were pretty great back in the day 	 It still is great it really stands the test of time I 'm always in the mood to put on the album Nevermind in my car or anywhere
Have you seen the movie Bridesmaids 	 Yes it 's one of my favorite comedies
One of my favorite movies when I was little was Mary Poppins 	 That was a great disney movie
Metallica is horrible 	 Not their old stuff
Because if it comes short the ball is still live and the opposing team can return it 	 Haha yeah like bama and auburn game from a few years back
Oh you 've got to be kidding You did n't Betrayal 	 Dude look seriously Am I proud of it No But when it became apparent the Cowboys were n't going to pull off a tie much less a score of any kind in the not-humiliating category I was n't taking any chances

Something that sets it apart 	 They tried building a wall of ivy
Yeah He is the best 	 Who is in the movies
Yes but his thinking hurt him believing that he caused Mufassa 's death 	 Scar was very manipulative but Simba looked up to him

Wonder woman was great 	 I know I was surprised
Tough question My favorite is but would I like it so much without the first one 	 So part of why you like it so much is because it calls back to the first one
Do you go to games in person often I do n't but I 'm not close to one 	 I 've been before but I do n't go often
I do n't know probably Selena Gomez 	 I rememeber her from Disney Channel does she sing now

It really did but it always had great beats and great lyrics 	 That 's what I love about it His tunes are always memorable
So people like Patsy Cline and Waylon Jennings 	 Exactly As for newer artists I just think Sam Hunt incorporating rap into country is awful
Something you want more of 	 It 's a little rustic too kind of like roasting food on a fire
I still think Denver would get the AFC side I know Peyton 's not their anymore but they are still good 	 Denver takes a lot of former Dallas players so that is what makes them good I wonder who their quarterback is
Emma watson is a good hermoine too 	 Yes this movie made really good casting choices

Does she find them 	 That would be a spoiler But it has a happy ending
It 's Formation and MCMXC a.D. its the one that has my favorite Sadeness song on their But they have so many great ones that you would have a lot to choose from 	 Thanks for the new music idea I will check them out as soon as possible

Yeah it 's sweet I like Lady Madonna 	 Which one is that
I havent actually its been around years since I went to a concert 	 Oh I see and what was that concert about or who was the main artist
I really think in a few years he is going to be the next George Strait His voice is so unique 	 I 'm not sure if anyone can come close to George Strait He is a classic

You ca n't blame that all on the defense 	 But you ca n't say that the defense was very good either

Yeah it feels like something we could get from Celine Dion 	 It really does I could see her singing it in her Vegas show too
Who then became the L.A. Raiders 	 Who then became the Oakland Raiders
Maybe they 'll play a couple new tracks Get the internet speculating a little 	 Would n't be a terrible idea actually
Oh yeah Deflate-gate add what was that other issue they had 	 There was the thing a few years ago where they were accused of spying on other teams
I feel like Melissa McCarthy became famous because of that movie 	 Did you know her husband is in Bridesmaids too
Why so I like it 	 She does n't actually do anything All she really does is sing and dance
Oh that 's right he was divorced in the last movie was n't he 	 Right and the movie also focuses on how much of a cold hearted man he has become
It 's still fun to dance to 	 I am not saying that it is not It just does n't seem like the anthem of the 1980s to me
Who is your pick next year 	 I think the Spurs will win it all
Well they are the spurs afterall Do you think they can take it all the way 	 Yeah I do Golden State looks good too but something about this Spurs team has me

It 's too bad he died during the making of the movie 	 Yeah unexpectedly too
The Dallas Cowboys 	 I heard their new stadium is really massive and great for hosting the Super Bowl
Yeah that was one of their bigger hits but their lesser known songs were great 	 I never bought any of their albums

Does Keith Urban right his own songs 	 I 'm not sure he 's pretty good though
Where Sean Penn is about to kill Tim Robbins 	 Thats nuts that you would think that
That 's true I wonder if we will find out how humans lose the ability to speak as they do in the original Charlton Heston movie 	 I 've heard a lot of bad things about the new Transformers movie that just came out
His music is more of a rock and roll country 	 I really like that
Though you 've got to give the Rasheed Wallace era of the 2000s a fair shake too 	 Yeah he was a great player but he could have handled himself better
No they could not 	 They did keep his points down after that game
No but he should i think 	 Why dont you like him

Who is Boldin on now 	 The Lions I think

This is true and with Ferrell I bet this one has even more physical comedy 	 I wonder if they considered Steve Martin He has always been grerat with physical comedy
So which album of theirs should I listen to first 	 I 'm a fan of the album they have called Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix but really all of their albums are good
Yes She sounds so much like Billie Holiday 	 I agree I also think that Lady Gaga sounds like Ella Fitzgerald
How so 	 Well they leave many of the small details out of the books out
A good funny part of the movie though When that girl was going nuts over the extinct plant 	 Yeah and she did n't see the dinosaur behind her
Yeah he had started the year out so strong He had posted a ERA in April 	 Yeah the Phillies need him to find that type of performance more consistently
Treat yourself and go there is nothing like the movie experience 	 I guess when you say it that way its true
What song are you listening to 	 Oh that 's Chandelier
Yes 	 Did they ever produce a love ballad
I think a sequel might be good but it 's been years since the original Do you think the original cast could hack it 	 I think so Milla Jovovich still looks great and Bruce Willis just has less hair
It 's called cross over If a track is huge within a genre it will leave the genre and become pop music 	 I see but what genres are most likely to generate pop hits
George Micheal was so sexy 	 Do you remember that song by George Micheal called Careless Whisper
Do you like the artist David Guetta 	 Yes he made that song Titanium

I ca n't believe the Mets tied it up in the 9th 	 The angles had it but you know their pitching
I think there was enough experimentation for the track to flow well 	 Yeah I agree and lyrically he was on top of his game
Perhaps but they need to overhaul their roster 	 We will see what about the Bears
Well he does n't even know the words to the song 	 Really That 's messed up
That 's exactly my problem but I like a lot of his music 	 I thought he was done being popular but then he came back in and released that song Sorry and I knew that was going to be a big hit
Oh cool so tell me more about the movie what makes it so special 	 Well it has a lot of actions and good vfx but that 's not what made it so cool
They did n't get played to much on the radio here 	 No they did n't Chains of Love was the hit here

Yes I do 	 Which album
Oh my gosh that might get me in trouble and make me feel like rebelling 	 I know I do n't like to drink because then I just get tired and I 'm already tired enough But sometimes I would just like to be sitting on the couch with my feet up not running to a department store to get new lights because the old ones do n't work on the tree
He is often compared to Eminem 	 Oh yeah I think I saw one of his videos on Facebook
I definitely love dogs-do you want to go with me 	 definitely-and anybody else who is in dog rescue and loves dogs
What Indiana Pacer did Knicks fan Spike Lee anger during the playoffs by calling him Cheryl A Reggie Miller 	 Reggie miller
In what way 	 Well he could have killed Rey He was even sad killing his dad
What else should I see 	 Hangover
Uh yeah 	 Who you rooting for
It must have been such pressure for all of them 	 It was down to two trios at the end and then Lucas picked the three we all know and love
So the guy think he 's out for revenge but it turns out the person messing with him was seeking his own revenge 	 Oh yea I remember it now It was super graphic and violent too
Do you still listen to pop music today 	 There are some pop artists that I like I think Adele is really good
I forgot about that movie We could use more cyberpunk films like that 	 Cyberpunk movies went out of style years ago
That 's amazing That would be cool to see 	 It defintely would I think they are even going to have Grace Vanderwaal
Hello 	 How 's it going
That 's what I like 	 Is that the one that talks about strawberry champagne
Really I do n't know man sometimes I go back and forth 	 Are you kidding me They redefined an era of music
Maybe if they had cast someone else 	 I do n't think it was Will Smith who ruined the film
They played very well off of each other 	 You could really tell by watching the movie
Yes he would he 's been a Cub for a long time 	 He sure has years
Really How long have you been a fan 	 Ever since I was age so that makes it about years For some reason their music has always been cool to me
I gotcha I find Tupac 's aural components relaxing whereas Class A z lyrical construction relaxes me 	 I think that 's what I mean
I know right So cliche 	 Its always ending with the huge scary robot noise
Yeah I had all his song when I was in school 	 I had a poster of him in the 's
Oh man that 's scary I 'd just hide in my house 	 Some people in the movie try that
Because it promotes low-class culture which I ca n't stand 	 I agree with Owen Wilson just because of his obnoxious voice
Me too and there 's so much to talk about 	 Do you have a favorite kind of music
Clint Eastwood was the director 	 The movie won many awards at the Academy Awards
What happened to him 	 Injuries He was robbed of his speed when he blew out his knees
Is n't he a music producer 	 He sure is I 'm not sure who he has produced though
No that was a rapper 	 I think I 've been confused by that a few times
Peoples music interests changed I dont think its that big of a deal 	 I think a good amount of people still do it
I mean everyone likes Disney movies 	 Haha Lighten up bro
Yes bass is the focal point and I love bass 	 The progression of the songs really gets me too
I am not going to tell you that part but I will say that his companions carried on in his stead 	 So there was some sort of positive conclusion to the affair
Oh man like Sandstorm That 's such a great dance song 	 I agree I could dance all night to it and it 's long too so it gets me through some tough track sessions
Yea it is just so relaxing and easy to listen to 	 I am surprised the genre is not more popular
I hear Sleight is supposed to be good 	 -LCB- -RCB-
And it looks like her ex-husband comes back for a bit That 's a set-up for some complications 	 More and more movies are showing women without the perfect lives
I am too He 's not the greatest tight end but he 's decent 	 I 'd also like to see them sign Nick Mangold We need a center
They can be but the genre 's not all about being scary 	 It 's not about horror and gore
And why he was in that black suit 	 I liked The Force Awakens as well
Tell that to the Bears 	 I wish I could I think they are killing this team
This was a really cool showing It was in a park in downtown Switzerland and hey showed it outside like a drive in movie 	 That must have been fun
I agree 	 Plus Odell Beckham is on a mission
Yes I also thought Coldplay was really good 	 Do you mean is really good
A couple of my friends like that team 	 They 're not bad and back in the day it was like they were one big family just enjoyable to watch
That is a very scary position to be in 	 Yeah but you kind of see how it helps her in the end I wo n't say any more than that for fear of giving spoilers
I guess some things we will never know 	 It 's too bad I wish they 'd make a sequel and tell us

I love that surf music like Jack Johnson 	 I know Can you believe Brushfire Fairytales came out in
Yes most Marvel movies were better than Green Lantern 	 Most Marvel movies are better than DC movies
Hey how do you think the Texans will do this year 	 I think they are going to be pretty good since they got rid of Oswyler and drafted DeShawn Watson
Absolutely do you think the show is good too 	 i think the show is okay but could be different
Sounds boring 	 Kinda is boring
It had the biggest opening for a P-G rated movie and the biggest opening ever in March which is pretty incredible considering how diverse kid fans are 	 I 'm sure Emma Watson probably appealed to both girls and boys since she was in the Harry Potter movies
I do n't know if he does or not but he sounds good 	 What 's it called
I do too One of the scariest I 've seen is The Strangers with Liv Tyler 	 I saw that too Very suspenseful
the band members?i think they are 	 have you listened to their latest album
honestly it will probably be the patriots again 	 haha yeah maybe Brady is unstoppable
I like that song it 's so wierd 	 It is but it 's very truthful

I know which one you are talking about 	 I like the duet with brad paisley too
Chewy of course 	 And least favorite
Understandable So I guess you 're a Packers fan 	 I 'm more partial to the Packers yeah
I think he was a lobster I had a Ariel barbie doll that I took with me to the pool every summer 	 The one with the clip on tail

We can but I don t wan na be late for the movie Love Johnny D 	 He 's a great actor for sure
It 's interesting to see how much Sia 's voice has changed since then as well 	 True true Did Guetta do Without You as well

Are you going to see Guardian 's of the Galaxy 	 Yes I ca n't wait
I know but do n't you think he is a classic singer 	 sure what is your favorite song of his
Why do you like the Cardinals and not the Cowboys 	 I think Larry Fitzgerald is one of the best receivers if not one of the best players to ever play the game
Who are the best kickers in the NFL 	 Well I think Gostkowski has a claim
Not even when you 're playing the games that have music 	 Well yeah when I 'm playing games I kind of have to listen to it
Yeah Doomsday is always under represented outside of pure comics 	 A lot of people had never heard of him
Exactly How about Drops of Jupiter 	 Train classic also do n't forget Save Me San Francisco
Yeah but he was a wide receiver for a while first 	 He did n't do that bad with his switch plus they drafted a few new backs
Their offense totally dropped off with him out 	 They did n't do jack in the playoffs because of it
My favorite team is the New Orleans Saints 	 Why is your favorite team the Saints
Did you look at the lyrics all I was saying is that one line over and over and over 	 Now I know you joking I know he says more than that in the song
Ever been to a game 	 I have when I was a kid
That 's a weird combination Where do you get your love for both types of music 	 Well my family is really into R&B and I like Country music because i 'm from Nashville and it 's really big there
I heard that one was pretty good 	 Yea it has not been out to long
Most of the religious stuff is secondar to the meanings I impart from it 	 I really see a lot of religion in their music

Have you seen the music video 	 Nope is it good
To soothe us and let us express our emotions 	 That is a sound point

Who is Burial 	 You do n't know who Burial is
Hearing you really make me want to see it 	 I tell you you wo n't reget it and it will help you through some situations you are facing
I think they are entertaining and can fire a team up 	 The CFL is different than the NFL They are lenient and let multiple players celebrate
Well for one thing why were the scientists so furious when they discovered what Jake was doing with the video logs How could they have not known what he was doing the whole time 	 I see And what else

I do n't know After last night 's game I do n't see it happening 	 Wall did a pretty good job for the Wizards He was the highest scorer I think
Who is your favorite rapper 	 I would have to say Eminem
He gets credit for nothing And performers put it on their resume without doing anything 	 But he came up with the idea so he deserves it
You remember Master P 	 Yeah I remember his music played all the time in the club like fifteen years ago
It was sad that he was tricked to turn to the dark side and sad about Padme 	 And that he almost died and wore the suit

This is true because some of these people you did n't know if they were still around or not 	 Like Bo Derek Who do you think is older her or the Hoff
I know I was so saddened that day I 'm really interested to see how Lucasfilms will include her Do you think she 'll get a reunion with Kylo Ren 	 I think if they somehow manage to use Princess Leia there has to be some moment with her son Kylo Ren

The Stargate series 	 No no I mean the Disney animated movie

Yea the sequals are also pretty good 	 Any you do n't like
Yes I love that one 	 I love the animation style
I dont know about that but how many years do you wear stuff 	 Usually about once
but songs like pulse and vermillion made up for it 	 thats when they got softer
Is it a drama 	 Oh yeah Very much so But the beauty of it is that it 's so simple
They have been they all are great 	 I want to see get out it looks like a funny horror movie
In my opinion this was by far the creepiest role he ever played 	 I think I will take your word for it I am nervous about watching this one

Why that one 	 Because it 's fast has plenty of room and looks like it would be fun to fly
He did and his rookie season was the year they won the World Series 	 Who was their manager that year
Without a doubt clearly a lot went on with Luke and Leia and everyone for that matter 	 Besides just the healing of Luke Leia seemed to suddenly know a lot about Luke 's powers for someone who had n't seen them in previous movies

Yes but it took two miracle last second wins 	 So how many games

Did you like Thor 	 Yes that was a good movie
Howard Cosell breaking in 	 The worst news I 've ever heard
That was kind of before they decided to ruin it by making it a franchise 	 He switched faces and disguises quite a bit in that movie
I did and thought it wasnt that good 	 Yeah it was too long in between and the jokes and situations did not seem plausible
Yeah it came out last year 	 I thought so Last I heard it was well received by critics
What does it sound like 	 It 's a collection of percussion instruments It 's amazingly beautiful music
I 'm not sure if they have any newer albums released but their older stuff is great 	 I 'll keep that in mind what genre are they

Why I heard it was supposed to be really good 	 I heard that too Maybe that 's why I was disappointed

Eleanor Rigby 	 There was definitely such a unique quality about that one
It sure does Those three songs have been released as singles before the album came out 	 I thought so I think I need to go buy this album as well
Sometimes I still secretly listen to them 	 I knew it It 's ok I do too
What kind do you like 	 I enjoy some slasher and cheesy ones mostly
They did What 's it about 	 It 's called Finding Dory So they 're gon na focus on her

Yes this team has made it to the superbowl back to back Loss one and won one 	 So what so has the Cowboys Matter fact the Cowboys made it to the Superbowl more than the Seahawks
It was a tough match between Rhianna and Beyonce 	 As far as wearing red goes Lady Gaga takes the cake
I said earlier here look Pat 's yards/game divided by Cowboy 's yards/game is equal to This Does n't mean the Pats will hve better time running it means Pats will struggle against the Cowboy 's run defense 	 Wait can we check this against last year 's record
Yeah he 's young but I like him 	 Yeah He throws a bit weird
There really were n't a whole lot of songs in that movie though At least not compared to some of the movies 	 I wonder if it will be the same storyline and if they will have Mushu
I 'm also going to be watching Jordan Howard 	 He looks really good as well He only found the end zone times but he did rush for yards he is going to do good things for the bears if he stays with them

I do n't know if I 'm a fan I 'm a bit of a purist 	 Me too I grew up with the original Star Wars three and I 'm not all that interested in the new franchise
Sure It would make jiu jitsu that much harder 	 What if hockey players were allowed to use jiu jitsu
Hah Thats a bit complicated and I dont expect Caruso but I like a good tonal range with a bit of Verb on High Notes 	 Still what about say other interests and especially so if vocalists etc.
I thought the same thing when I saw First Dates I remember that being hilarious 	 But in hindsight Sexism and gay jokes just make you cringe
I miss Lady Gaga 's earlier work 	 Her early work was good but her new stuff is n't bad
I have n't heard that 	 Well I just went to a hair band tribute band the other night It was rockin

I liked when they made the sword too 	 Yeah that was awesome Just all around a great movie

DId you ever see them in concert 	 Yes I seen them at Nautica downtown Cleveland Ohio
Yeah it 's almost like they knew that it would be their last time together and they wanted to go out with a bang 	 I also like Revolver that 's really an underrated album and really brought psychedelic music out of its shell
Not back then movie makers seem to be able to get away with more than they do now 	 Was n't that a Mel Brooks movie
I need to bring earplugs next time 	 Did you understand the lyrics
Hey same here Do you have a favorite song 	 I 'd definitely have to go with One I just love how the song goes from being so mellow to a barrage of thrash metal
Actually heavy metal has become very popular in Europe lately and most of the best bands are European 	 No kidding What are some examples
Nickelback is coming we are thinking about going 	 I like them but not sure it 's worth the money

IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN BRING SOME DRINKS 	 YES I WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU THEN

What 's unknown they know what the crocodile is going to do 	 Yea but they ca n't see the crocodile They do n't even know if it 's still there

Yeah he has a very good sound in my opinion 	 He 's not American is he
Did you like The Who 	 Yeah Baba O Riley is still a hit in my eyes

It makes me want to watch the movie again right now 	 I know I was thinking the same thing I like how Disney is doing this with other movies too
Definitely it 's amazing Too bad it does n't help them win 	 No but dak Prescott might just be the one to change all that
Do you think the Lions have a shot of winning the NFC Central 	 I seriously do think they have a good chance The Packers looked vulnerable last year and you never know about Aaron Rodgers health especially with that weak offensive line he has
One of my favorite parts was when Edward took Carter to the racetrack 	 Oh I know and Carter got to drive the Mustang Shelby
Who do you think is the last jedi in the next Star Wars movie 	 I think it is Rey
I know He 's the most mobile quarterback in the league so of course they turned him into a pocket passer 	 Why did they do that He was in good shape before he got hurt was n't he
I 'll agree with you there He 's got talent and that 's easy to see 	 The last Super Bowl was a pure showcase of his ability to perform under pressure

Because movies are fun why else 	 I beg to disagree

Well it seems like they keep making those too and they do kinda decline in quality over time 	 Well yeah but I guess they just run out of ideas maybe
See the Bruins are better 	 No they are not tickets have nothing to do with how good a team is
How about we stay in and watch the movie Seven 	 What kind of movie is that
Her size really added to the oddity of the character 	 Also the oddity of the situation
I agree he did a lot for the community 	 Their death was tragic to the entire nation
Maybe but they do n't have Bill Belichek or Mike Tomlin either 	 What would Belichek and Tomlin do differently for the Bengals
There are a lot of great stories on the subject 	 Did you see the one with Clive Owen
No I mean I like light operetta it 's fun But Merle Haggard is fun too especially the way he carries low notes 	 Wow great point and this conversation is really interesting But isnt Opera and Operetta really dated
Yeah Pioli ruined Kansas City 	 None of their backups have had much success either
Is that the space movie with the alien 	 Yea there was a ton of ads for it pretty recently
Any of those sci fi movies always look best on the big screens 	 Yes I agree about that I saw Avatar on the big screen and totally fell in love with that movie

It is up there especially with the cast 	 I loved when they united the team
They were pretty big when we were in high school 	 I know they were on the radio all the time
You will like it 	 Im going to get it
I think that 's one of the best aspects of the movie We 're so used to cheering on the good guy and rooting against the bad guy This movie gives us both sides and it 's more of an expressive retelling of a segment in racing history 	 It was definitely entertaining One of my favorite all time movies now I 'll be watching this again as I did buy the bluray
That was pretty good too 	 I like tom Cruise in movies
I guess that could work But I personally see it being a problem with the players 	 Of course it would be a problem with them They want to make as much money without working more for it
Yet it poses an interesting question One that 's still pertinent today 	 I 'm not sure I 'm following you What 's the question exactly
Their main office is at Valley Ranch 	 I think that is in Irving Texas
That is not glass 	 What is it
Seattle is going deep again though I would n't be surprised if they went all the way once all the egos and feelings got put aside 	 Patriots against Seattle

That one is worth the top spot 	 I have never seen it
Any favorite Rock group or duo 	 I loved the Everly Brothers

Well he believes in never-ending music There is no repeating music whatsoever 	 Why is that bad
My favorite is the Battle of Hoth 	 Which part of the Battle of Hoth because that 's a pretty long battle

Yes He does not yet know of his sad past nor the dark future ahead of him 	 That is even before he meets Draco Malfoy
They 're in the same conference so they would n't be in the championship 	 You said championship not Super Bowl I 'm assuming the AFC championship
Its so hard to pick just one but Its Gon na Be Me is up there in my top favorites along with This I Promise You 	 This I Promise You is SUCH a beautiful song
I do n't think she has new albums but she has a few singles that she released in the last few months 	 Have you seen her perform live
Yeah I did n't really care for that one 	 Really I thought it was a very interesting story
The Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors are in the finals 	 Again That 's crazy
Yupp and the whole power struggle they had was interesting 	 What would you do with a magic genie

Yeah I think as long as he stays out of trouble than he can get the stats needed for the MVP 	 I guess I can see that Staying out of trouble is going to be key for him
Hmmmm I liked the Empire Strikes Back but I also really liked Revenge of the Sith I 'll say the prequel series 	 I liked Revenge of the Sith too I liked the idea of Obi Wan and Annakin Skywalker working together to rescue the Chancellor and their adventures
A lot of the QBs are in the high 30s to low 40s though 	 Yep Think the highest amongst the QBs is Ryan Fitzpatrick with which points below perfect score

Who cares I hate that guy 	 He is pretty terrible
You 've given me some really good recommendations 	 Oh I can talk all day about their songs

Well I guess she could write one with the kids grown up and have it have something to do with their kids 	 Exactly Remember when the kids were introduced at the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
Hmm Let me think about that one 	 Who would you pick to create an enforcer baseball team a team of players -LRB- pitcher included -RRB- that you would never want to bean with a pitch and have a bench clearing brawl against

He 's handsome and he 's so sarcastically funny 	 He can even turn a superhero movie into a comedy Just look at Ant-Man
A musician 	 Maybe I know some of her music name a couple songs
If you had a favorite who would you pick 	 I would say Alice in Chains
I know Steve Tyler is great 	 I have liked them since the 's
I hated Kevin Bacon 's character in that movie at the start he seem like such a know it all as the lead investigator 	 I know I almost forgot Kevin Bacon was in it Remember when Kevin Bacon was in every movie
They 're going to be really disappointed down in Las Vegas when he fumbles away half his touchdown chances 	 The Raiders are still in Oakland for a couple of years Lynch will retire again before they move
Wonder Woman 	 It 's not out yet
Cowboys are healthier and the Packers are always good 	 We will see what happens
I wonder how they did Beast 	 I 'm not sure but I bet it required a lot of make up and CGI
That is the story when harry almost found some kind of family with a god father He also steps up and uses more spells 	 Do you have a favorite harry potter character
Name a female singer who put her heart soul and guts into her music 	 Well if you are talking Old School that would be Aretha Franklin Her version of Ai n't No Way is angelic
I just watched Enemy of the State again 	 Yeah Which one was that
I do n't think so what is it called 	 I think it is called Malibu
I 'm going to go see him at Electric Zoo soon 	 Oh really
Oh wow LCD Soundsystem I have n't seen them since their final show at Madison Square Garden 	 This will be my first time seeing them so I 'm very excited
See any good movies lately 	 Not really
Do you enjoy NFL football 	 Yes I do Have always watched
Michael Meyers was creepy 	 Yes especially with that mask
Do you listen to old pop music from when you were growing up 	 I sure do Stuff I did n't really like at the time is enjoyable now because of the nostalgia
in hip hop 	 yea
Speaking of Bieber I love his new song with Daddy Yankee Despacito 	 Oh me too who knew he could speak Spanish
But what I 'm also saying is I did n't think they needed to exist and both sequels were great films 	 That 's very true it 's hard to distrust Disney and Pixar at this point
I have a hard time sitting through whole movies anymore 	 Me too I did rewatch Babadook
I played Love the Way you Lie and No Love a ton 	 I liked those a lot and I thought they were great collaborations Rihanna and Lil Wayne were amazing
Ya that is her she is is so great Worked with lots of artists including Michael Jackson 	 Pretty cool Miley cyrus too also in the video
In the late 's I think 	 Do you have any of their albums
Not really it was just cool that I grew up from where they were raised 	 What else about them did you like
Not bad you 	 Same
Not much Just listening to music 	 Yeah like what
Then they could lower the basket so that six footers could dunk 	 It 's interesting to think about Do you think you would play more then
I know And I really liked the pace of the movie too 	 Yes It does take time to establish things And there are so many things to consider in that story
That really old one 	 Yeah
No doubt All Dak Prescott has to do is not be bad and they should be able to win 	 How do you think Ezekiel Elliot will do this year
I finally completed my goal of seeing every movie on the AFI top list 	 Wow that is impressive What was your favorite movie
Absolutely Saturday for example there are a bunch of free bands performing as well as a glass making display a woman twirling hoops and a guy who rides a unicycle that is dressed up like a unicorn So there 's lots of free music but other things to see too 	 I kind of thought of Pennsylvania as being a serious bunch of people I did n't know they loved music and loved performances of all kinds so much
What tunes 	 Slaughter to prevail
Yes My real life 	 Can we at least listen to Cry Baby
I do n't think so 	 It has that blonde chic from Game of Thrones in it
I 'm more of an 80s gal myself Those colors I 'm also really loving the exposed bra trend 	 Me too We spend so much on bras it 's time to show them off
This movie is actually a continuation of the story from Prometheus 	 Does it have the same characters
That will make me mad forever Jack Dawson did n't have to die 	 He was such a great character though
I just do n't think it has the same type of suspense that horror films typically have Such as a Friday the 13th movie or The Blair Witch Project 	 I think it possesses the familiar subject matter of horror films I believe it has some level of suspense coupled with strange supernatural monsters
Is this move in 3d or I max 	 Yes it is showing in real 3d and I max
Sure is 	 Good I hate it when they change up directors
did you like cars 	 the first was okay
It was really good I love Jonah Hill he cracks me up 	 Me too He was hilarious in Grandma 's Boys
Well I guess for the kind of actor he was he had a n image to uphold His fans may have not liked that coming from the Duke 	 Their loss I say It could have been pretty hilarious
Me too I hope they play Bulls on Parade 	 That 's definitely a good one
There are two teams in LA 	 Clippers Well I am not a fan at all
No what did he say 	 He said he was pimping it and that we have seen it from him enough
Does Minor League baseball provide as much excitement as the Major Leagues 	 It depends on the type of baseball you like to watch
It stars John Goodman and it 's about a filmmaker in the 1960s who wants to use the fear of the Cold War to make his new horror film the scariest ever 	 Is it a horror film
Yeah It just came out on friday 	 Wow I feel old Who is even playing bond these days
I agree one of the strengths of theirs was in the lyrics I think they all wrote certain songs 	 I believe you are correct though most were paul and john I think
I 'm sure Freddie Freeman is loving that 	 I still miss Turner Field though
Awesome Can you compare their type of sound to any other bands 	 Like I said they sound a lot like Sneaker Pimps when Kelly Dayton was vocalist They also sound kind of like In This Moment
Yes That is correct 	 If you look at the music video people say that the amount of dancers represent on how many people were killed during the tragedy
The New Mickey Mouse Club 	 That was lame
I used to watch it when I was a kid 	 I remember it was really popular
Well the movie really skewers Hollywood and the Entertainment Industry 	 That sounds interesting Anything more specific about it
Want me to help 	 Would be swell thanks
Well it 's a Tom Cruise action film but it is different from his others 	 Like the Mission Impossible or Jack Reacher series
Did you like it 	 Yes i liked it I just didnt like the ending with the two guys dancing
I agree with that its very odd 	 Do you think that any will make a new one
VI is awful and was made to market to kids The happy ending and teddy bears overthrowing the empire 	 Yeah but they 're cute
I bet it is driving Belichick insane 	 Yes I bet it is
Flacco had a very good game He had passing yards and he threw touchdowns 	 What did Miami 's rushing look like
I know and believe me my neighbors are n't happy about it 	 Do they give you flack on game days
Ha I totally agree But are there even many death metal shows that come through our area 	 Oh yeah It 's more common than you 'd think Probably at least tour every month Here I 'll show you some upcoming concerns in our area
I mean it is be natural and not drawn out 	 But we wanted a faithful adaption
No doubt but it does n't mean they wo n't act like they do n't know They might take a developing player but they 're not going to accept a medire one 	 Do you think Melo definitely wants out
Good did you have a good weekend 	 Yeah me and the wife went to see a movie
What did you think 	 Wonderfully done great music great actors I can see why this movie won so many awards this year
What do they play 	 Classical sounding rock
Oh cool Ryan Gossling is it in too right 	 Yep got to love that Also Harrison Ford returns should be pretty awesome
It was one of the saddest deaths in the movies 	 Obiwan 's death was put there to help develop Luke as a character for theatrical purposes as well
Would you ever want to see a movie about what went on between Empire and Jedi 	 Without a doubt clearly a lot went on with Luke and Leia and everyone for that matter
See that was unproven 	 Still we all know it happened
Yes he will 	 A.J. Boule and Jalen Ramsey are great corners
Yeah it 's sad too I really enjoy music with a story 	 It definitely feels more intellectual that way I like both styles
Yes and I loved it One of the best movies I 've seen in awhile 	 I know same here I 've actually been to see it times now
Which pop music band is your favorite 	 I think it has to be the Beatles
That type of stupid humor is the best Do you like Groundhog Day 	 Who does n't It 's a classic and Bill Murray is funny in everything
You definitely should It 's a slow burn but the dialogue is so good There 's light hearted moments but things turn dark quickly too 	 Thanks for the heads up Smashed is going on my list of movies to catch
She is working on an album and also I think performing at some smaller venues 	 It 's great to see her having so much success after having so many problems in her life
Yes i saw it 	 What did you think
I wonder what new characters there will be 	 I do n't know Hopefully more Doc He was great
Everyone knows that The Empire Strikes Back was the best Star Wars movie 	 I disagree with that It was the best
Have you ever seen any movies with Chevy Chase 	 Yeah I love that actor
Dak and Zeke are amazing but makes you think they wo n't flake out in their sophmore year 	 I think Prescott has the maturity to keep going he 's already shown his leadership with the old guys I just hope Elliott does n't get himself hurt with all his gymnastics
No I didnt was it good 	 Yes I liked it and think its a must see
Of course C3PO and R2D2 stole the show 	 I do love Droids
Yup and the cheeseheads 	 And the Steelers
And the half 	 Bills
What was your favorite part 	 It was actually pretty sad so no favorite parts
They are lucky to be tied in this series and you 'd have to imagine the Celtics would hopefully avoid being down at home in game 	 I like the Celtics chances I definitely think this will go games
And he did all of his own singing 	 I also thought the grandma in this was quite beuatiful as she became part of the ocean
They are good but I always liked College more 	 Agree to disagree
Well they made Jack different in this movie 	 How so
Are you familiar with the twilight zone 	 Yeah why
Quite badly 	 How so
So have you seen any good movies lately 	 I saw Beauty and the Beast last week
A lot of music from the eighties 	 Why the Eighties
She has a solo career 	 That 's cool I 'll check her out
No way NFL is so much better than college ball 	 I disagree College football has the rivalries The color The music So much more
What were the songs she sang before driving into the air during Super bowl performance in 	 Those were parts of the songs God Bless America and This Land is Your Land
For example I would would say I love Elvis 	 Right on Love me Tender is an oldie but goodie
Yeah the only one that comes close in my mind was Calvin Johnson 	 I think Randy Moss and Terrell Owens were two of the best ever
One of the steelers Franco Harris I believe managed to catch the ball keeping it in play 	 No way
Yes all of the guardians are back as well as a few new characters 	 Does Vin Diesel still play Groot 's voice
Well maybe I 'll watch it tonight 	 Remember what my favorite animated movie of all time was
No I was so busy in December that I did n't have a chance to see it 	 I think it will come out on video soon
Ok that scores some points 	 It is a great overall story full of drama and thrills
Yes and to keep the puck in play 	 That is cool
We all have to have one fault 	 I do n't know if I could do his diet and life style but it sure works for him
A cool basketball player 	 Meh I think he 's okay
Yes definitely 	 Did you have any of the same toys as in the movie
Yes of course 	 What do you think of them
Do you have a favorite movie 	 I have several favorites and the answer changes with my mood Do you have a favorite
Are you a fan of Wes Carpenter movies 	 Yes I am He is a good director of horror movies
You 're right but there 's some good music done in every decade Just a lot more bad stuff in the 70s 	 I can see your point but I have some fond memories of 70s music
There were only IMAX cameras in the world at the time 	 Yeah and they destroyed one of them
Ok it had it 's high points 	 Yeah like seeing the start of Darth Vader as an innocent kid
Has she been nominated for the Grammy 's ever 	 Well I do n't think she has any Grammy nominations but she has had several nominations in Teen Choice Awards
What can you tell me about classical music 	 It 's harder to explain everything just has to be perfect
Was there anything you wish you had requested 	 Honestly I wanted them to play something silly
I 'll have to download the album 	 I would highly recommend it Long live the Wu
They should Their voices have been very symbolic in all the movies 	 Also Rex 's voice it 's one of the best Who is that actor
I really hope so I 'm not much of a Penguins fan so I 'm cautiously optimistic 	 You do n't like Sidney Crosby
Wow did you do the pleading yourself 	 Hes your would be surprised how difficult it is I had to look in so many fashion magazines to get an idea
Would n't it Be Nice is a special song 	 What do you like about it
Freddie Mercury had an awesome voice 	 He actually seemed like he would have been a character
That must have been a strange thing to watch and listen to 	 It was To be honest Hollywood blockbusters have been letting me down in recent years
I find that I do n't listen to any of the new stuff because I do n't like it much There are a few songs that I like 	 Like what
I really like selena gomez as an actress 	 Me too
Why did you do that 	 -LCB- -RCB-
Yea They may not be the most complex songs but they 'll stay in your mind for weeks 	 Whoever produces her music is really good at what they do
His guitar playing was great I loved it in A Hard Day 's Night 	 Which band member do you like best
So did you like the movie sound track 	 Of course man Star Wars music is my jam
Anna literally sacrifices herself for her sister as an act of true love 	 It never would have worked if she knew that was what she had to do
YES NOT ONLY COULD HE SIGN BUT ALSO WROTE POEMS 	 WOW THATS GREAT TO HEAR I MUST LISTEN TO THEM
True but you can never count the G.O.A.T Tom Brady out 	 Yea the cheating Patriots never fails
It is the only album that is like reading an audio book 	 That sounds educational
Yeah straight beast and a top receive in the league 	 He was injured a lot last year I think
So many people have made fun of them over the years 	 They 're kind of a punchline but there 's tons of bands that are worse
What were the best touchdown dances you have ever seen in NFL history 	 Wow that 's a good question I 'm guessing I would have to go back a few years because players ca n't get too crazy anymore
I really hope they make a sequel soon 	 I have no doubt that they will
It was a shame he passed away 	 I know he was perfect though
I thought George Martin was the producer 	 He was and he made a lot of contributions but the engineer did a lot too
I hope so for his sake He 's been touring forever now 	 Yeah he 's a veteran now Getting up their in age now as well
Yes she has many songs I like 	 I love the Rehab the one she sings with Justine Timberlake
Agreed My favorite is What 's My Age Again 	 That 's the quintessential Blink-182 song
Whats your favorite kids movie 	 I love so many I am not sure I could choose one how about you
Well there 's Han solo Yoda ummm 	 Ill pick Yoda
I 'm pretty sure She 's a really talented musician 	 Agreed She 's also just such a cool artist
Now you do 	 Its such a sweet song
TY Hilton 	 Not a very big receiver but plays big Very quick and exciting to watch
Wow sounds interesting do you how how it works 	 Yeah you move the ball around and try to make as much contact with defender to get them to open up
He was so powerful so much force was in him 	 Yes and it went dark but Luke was powerful too
Tell me about your music 	 MY music or PA Dutch music
It will be good however to have a team in Las Vegas 	 Yes I ca n't wait to catch a game while I 'm there for business
Is dribbling a ball good or bad 	 Dribbling is good in the game of basketball
A few years ago 	 Any thoughts about the movie since then
I had heard that as well That was when she realized she was funny 	 Ya just something natural in her delivery and timing is pure comedic genius
Have you heard of people seeing musical notes as colors 	 What
I think it was funny when the cop came to the door and asked if everything was alright 	 i know right I started cracking up
Sometimes music contains subtle or hidden messages 	 Wow that 's interesting Can you give me an example
Ca n't be worse that this 	 Cool Let 's go
Who is directing it 	 According to imdb Chris Bouchard and Blake Harris
No way I did not know So who is staying in San Diego 	 Apparently no one we are very sad
Honestly not sure it seems wide open 	 Well I certainly do n't have the Bears
What kind of music is on there 	 It 's very relaxing Nothing too loud
I do n't listen to much new music but I like a lot of older songs 	 What 's your favorite style of music
He did n't direct the last Star Trek either 	 What is up with these studios
Yes she does n't have a very big vocal range at all 	 I like her still though
Do you like the Beatles 	 Yes
So something has been bothering me about Rey in the Force Awakens 	 I really like that one I like where they 're going with the new franchise
Who 's your favorite live performer ever 	 That I have seen
A band called His Gang 	 I think I may have heard of them
I do n't think I ever saw the third one I wonder how good it was 	 Can you think of any other sequels that surpassed the original
How do you get rewards for Disney movies 	 If you buy eligible movies or theater tickets you can enter it on the Disney website for points You can use the points for special offers or rewards
I KNOW BUT THE OFFENSE IS STILL SHAKY 	 I AGREE I AM NOT CONVINCED THEY HAVE A QUARTERBACK TO LEAD THEM TO THE PLAYOFFS
The finals doesnt even draw a ton of fans 	 Its also during the summer so its tough to compete
Soon i hope 	 How soon
Yeah 	 That after the beatles recored VI they had a show
The original there is no other one in my book 	 Well you 'd be wrong there are sequels and remakes but ok
What do you like about that movie 	 It 's more of today and there is action with comedy and the fighting kung fu
It 's interesting they cast Cate Blanchett I 'm looking forward to seeing her in this movie 	 I know They brought in a Oscar-winning actress
You know what I always thought was a really cool movie 	 No what was that
What movie have you seen recently 	 I saw Beauty and the Beast
The editor 's cape is fading into distant memory and is being replaced by something even less practical 	 Let me guess The laid back look of shrugged shoulder
You know I 've been wondering that 	 They have so many good players How do they fit under the cap
Still that 's not too much of competitive balance 	 Kind of sucks that it will be one of those teams again Cavaliers or Warriors
Exactly 	 I think she dyes it though
Yes it 's harder to really bond with a team and form a connection with the players 	 Who do you think the World Series champions are going to be this year
Again it 's another one of their movies that does n't have a happy ending or maybe even a satisfying ending 	 It 's morally corrupt characters who ca n't seem to catch a break and it 's difficult to watch them constantly mess up
Sure What 's not to like I love the classics like Snow White and Peter Pan 	 Me too I love Dalmatians The originals And the remakes too
Yeah not sure the PARENTS will like it much though 	 HAHA Also Rusted Root 's Send Me On My Way would be a good one
What do you mean 	 It 's like All rappers and hip hop artists seem to do is use cheap simple beats and only talk about drugs or alcohol or something
Why did n't I think of that one Yeah that one is really good 	 The music video for that one is really fun too
Possibly a stylist however it would not surprise me if she chose it on her own 	 Yes She has a unique wicked style all on her own
Well now that I think about it nope 	 Yeah no They 're horrible
I tuned in on the local rock music station and heard music from the 's I do n't think I heard anything new 	 Yea I 've heard
I loved the constrution scene 	 That was a good scene
Rodgers no doubt 	 See then clearly the Packers are one of the frontrunners
And 	 I ca n't figure out why they keep making these things
It is just so stupid Snyder should stop making movies 	 Yea none of his movies have been good for a very long time now
I did too Rey and Finn had such an awesome rapport 	 They really did Ah that movie was sweet funny exciting it had everything that the original Star Wars A New Hope was
While my guitar gently weeps was so good 	 I think that was a phenomenal song but there were betters
Yeah I think her music videos have largely influenced me to like her more They 're so intense and she always has great acting in them 	 I agree I also like how much she seems to care about being a good role model for young girls
I like the Panthers You 	 I 'm a 49ers fan
I will agree with that do you like pop 	 I do like some like taylor swif
He also had assists and only turnover 	 Kyrie also pitched in a respectable points
Man Lil wayne is such a bad rapper 	 I know right
Where is the venue 	 It 's going to be at an old skating rink
Yeah I know 	 What did you want to do
Because Belle is French 	 Wait really
Where Vader picks up the Emperor and throws him down that shaft 	 Yeah Here 's something I find weird I 've heard different explanations for that big explosion of blue energy
Exactly sheds light on an issue Makes a statement 	 For Elf I would make James Caan still hate christmas
You could be right but it 's hard betting against a team that has Sidney Crosby 	 Yeah Crosby is a stud and a game changer
Never heard of them what are they like 	 They 're a three-piece band from Wales They 're pretty heavy but very melodic Female singer
No its not that 's the same plot they used for the new Fast and Furious 	 Yea exactly
Those are the only three I 've seen 	 The ones after that are supposed to tell the story of what led up to those three
Do you like music 	 Sure Although I have no favorite
I like that song too Who wrote it again 	 The talented Lin-Manuel Miranda
Oh come on why not 	 Because Miami does not have to play them in regular season until December
who would be your pick 	 Celine Dion
Definitely I agree 	 Who do you think is the best though
Which Disney princess movie came first 	 I believe it was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
Yes and no It is more of a comedic drama It really cover alot 	 How is that like the other film
It originated in the 's initially fusing elements of Chicago house with 's jazz-funk and touches of soul music 	 Oh nice Like Calvin Harris and Disciples How Deep Is Your Love
yeah july 13th 	 it is going to be about buzz and bo Beep love story
the acting and story is just really too corny for my taste 	 i dont really like them either
Yes their dual-lead-guitar sound is pretty incredible in how the guitars interlock and harmonize 	 Metallica had some great albums and songs for sure but their music to me is not as intelligent
Its from their Dig Your Roots album It features the Backstreet Boys 	 Oh I do love the Backstreet Boys I do n't know how I feel about them teaming up with Florida Georgia Line though
Yea I do it had that old fashion looking postcard on the front 	 Yea great cover
Yeah I know I do like to listen to some of their recent live stuff of their most recent tours but I do tend to listen to a lot of their studio albums more often 	 I think a lot of Deadheads feel they never quite could reach their potential in their studio efforts
I know right The whole cd is fire 	 I like Baby Boy and I like Naughty Girl
But those are the good ones 	 I just feel weirded out
Oh from the original series that 's cool 	 Yeah they were actually pretty funny cameos
Yes free bird 	 What song is it you wan na hear
You are right Have you seen it till the end 	 Yes i did and it gave me goose bumps when the baby Elephant flew using his larger ears as wings
Made me feel awful for Paul Walker 	 A real tragedy They should n't have been racing
Um no I told you about Allisa who 's a biochemistry student and then Heather who 's the soccer player and then Kristen who wants to be a teacher and 	 Ok Stop So Biochem girl Ok What do YOU want to watch
Even if it 's not technically a mermaid movie it sounds like something that would be great to watch with mermaid movies 	 Exactly now all you need is some movie snacks Maybe some seaweed
Hey you like pop music 	 Yes i love it
Do you listen to country 	 Yes I love country
Even if you lived across the country you loved Dallas 	 Yeah they were like America 's team
I only remember seeing The Lion King and Aladdin 	 Those were both 's right
Tons I had n't been to a football game in ages 	 Who was playing
I love meghann trainor 	 Shes good
Why do you like Solo more 	 I love Harrison Ford plus I love his character arc
I am so bored right now 	 Me to how about we listen to some music
Or you know in a coffee shop 	 You know who else is good The Plane White T 's
One thing always stayed the same though That was Dumpledore 	 Yeah even in death he was the same old Dumpledore kind of kind and mystical
Have you seen mr and mrs smith 	 With brad pitt and angelina jo li
I find that hard to believe 	 Listen to Within Destruction You 'd be surprised by how it sounds
They have playoff appearances 	 They had playoff appearances in a row
How is it poor 	 Well you know how things move right
I have not heard that song 	 It is fabulous
Hard call he is so great in both 	 But if you had to pick
Do n't you think they may also regress after the emotional high 	 Brady is such a stoic I do n't think it 'll affect him

Haha it 's adorable 	 Maybe for you I have watched frozen at least times
I 'll agree with that she showed so much fire in her scenes and the action scenes definitely gripped me and had me locked in 	 I could n't believe they pushed it for the R-rating we finally got the Wolverine we 've always wanted to see in Logan
I had Let it Go stuck in my head for weeks after seeing that movie 	 Me too My favorite song from that movie though is Do You Wan na Build a Snowman
Wow I ca n't believe you still listen to that kind of music 	 What do you mean
Not bad for a guy who is 	 He 's been lucky
From Waking the Fallen They do actually play songs like Chapter Four and Second Heartbeat sometimes 	 Okay then I 'll check it out
I read the book what did you think about the mystery and drama in the movie version 	 Halfway through I thought its Justin Theroux
So disrespectful when he would take a knee during our National Anthem 	 You know who I miss Tim Tebow

It is very unique and special 	 Yes she has such a big vocal range and healthy belt
Sure I guess 	 That is n't even Mel Gibson that 's the guy who played Goose
Have you ever gone to a Dallas game 	 No but I did go see the Seahawks once
He 's an interesting character He 's a strong Jedi and he is a good mentor 	 Do you think so Even though his protege went to the Dark Side
Well he was of Mexican heritage His real name was Richard Valenzuela 	 I did n't know that Maybe I did and just forgot
He 's like a new John Legend for me 	 John 's voice is amazing
Yeah but thats not indicative of skill 	 Yes it is thats the only measure
Do you think Luke will fight Snoke 	 I think he and Rey have to at some point
That is still not a good enough answer 	 Well for example if it 's a scary movie I do n't want to waste a lot of money on other treats in case I start jumping in my seat You were there with me at Freddy vs. Jason
there not bad you goota giv them a chance 	 i like a couple of there songs
What does concise mean 	 I mean it is be natural and not drawn out
Overall Giacomini seems to be more closer than an average pass blocker rather than Clark who is well below-average 	 Not to mention that he has been riddled with back injuries through last season
No but I will see it 	 Are you looking forward to it
How many Star Wars movies was Chewbacca in 	 Five
There are just some movies that do n't need remakes 	 I agree with that
Yes I have been playing for ten years 	 Do you like playing classical music
Well the gravity on Mars is way lower than Earth but he was walking around normally 	 Sure that is understandable it is a movie after all
I still enjoy even listening to the radio once and a while 	 Me too except for the comercials
So what is your favorite punk band 	 I do n't know that it 's still considered a punk band but I really like Fall Out Boy
Unlike watching a movie where everything is right there in front of you 	 Exactly You can create your own version of the story apart from everyone else 's
Did you catch the twist at the ending 	 Kinda can you fill me in a bit

hey football season 's about to start 	 yeah i 'm really looking forward to this season
Jar Jar aside some of the characters are very compelling Qui Gone Jin for example played by Liam Neisen is amazing 	 I have to agree with you there He 's a good example of a courageous strong-willed Jedi And Darth Maul is a terrific villian too

No have you 	 Yeah they have Cars
Yeah but he 's not the best Sorry 	 Yeah there 's always gon na be a younger much better player than him So you say it 's Josh McCown
Oh yeah 	 But lately he 's doing youtube raps like the pancake rap

He finally got released to play a good season in Kansas City 	 Well he still made the Hall of Fame and had a great career
I 've liked all his music I 've heard on the radio I 've just never sat down and listened to a whole album 	 What 's your favorite song by him

Like what 	 Frankenstein
He was the quarterback over a number of good years 	 They have had many short term solutions
What is it about 	 The lyrics are all about empowering women and girls and doing things that nobody thinks you are capable of
What 's wrong with that 	 Well it 's misleading for one And if you get a no pick and get a star QB you should stick with it and improve the team
Yes the comedy is especially hillarious 	 I want to watch it soon
The punter makes the difference in a game so often by determining field position and a great punter can end another team 	 Oh yeah a punt followed by a safety is brutal
Andy Reid will keep them in it 	 He 's a good coach
I think that 's why 	 He did look as if he could be a rat
Maybe Miami they may come out of nowhere and do good 	 I do n't think so I think the Bears may surprise

So the other parks with the farther fences favor the pitchers more it sounds like 	 Yes Teams that play in those pitchers parks will structure their team differently than the other teams

They should have pulled him out the other day in that game when he went head first into the boards 	 I 'm going to be shocked if he makes it ten more years in the league he has had a lot of concussions
Good I hate that stuff 	 I also really liked The Hurt Locker
How can you not remember what your graduation song was 	 It might have been In My Life by The Beatles
I think the final cut was over and a half hours long so that 's why they trimmed it 	 Wow that would be like watching a hip hop Lord Of The Rings
The lyrics almost seemed an after thought 	 Yep You could just sing them without really taking in their meaning
So you root more for the players instead of the team 	 Yes I just find it better that way it gets me more invested in the game it also gives me more games to watch

That is such a classic I really liked her comedies 	 Yes Miss Congeniality was hilarious

Sounds like great plans there 's a Indiana Jones marathon on this weekend 	 Nice which channel
I only liked one song Black Hole Sun 	 They wrote so many good albums
I think Pittsburgh is the team to beat and would make a good opponent for the Vikings 	 You mean for the Cowboys
Right but I do love Vin Diesel as an actor so maybe it will be okay 	 I sure hope it will be I will still give it a chance
Why dont more female fronted bands exist 	 Tough question to be honest
Would you ever like to go to hogwarts 	 I wou d love to go to hogwarts
Probably not I 'm worried about movie theater related shootings 	 There 's a new trailer out

Was n't she a judge on American Idol 	 Yes she was
I will What is the best song on there 	 Flight Of The Eagle is my favorite
That was hilarious I do n't think I could walk around in a meat outfit 	 I also like Bad Romance do you like that one
This should be easy 	 Let 's put some Spoon on the playlist
I think he is the king of pop no doubt 	 He did sell a lot of records
That 's true 	 When they 're not busying stealing cars and getting into trouble they probably like to camp and stuff
The action hero shows near superhuman fighting skills 	 While the thriller lead endures unbelievable torment without giving in
So that they can get ready for the real series against the Warriors 	 I agree with you This was fine tuning for the Cavs
There was nothing like it back then they were way ahead of their time 	 Well I guess it 's true ca n't beat old school storytelling
Yeah that was majorly screwed up man I 'm pushing for the Steelers myself 	 Well if Big Ben wants another ring he 'd better hurry He 's getting a little long in the tooth and he ALWAYS takes a beating Talk about a team that needs an O-line
Yeah it appears despite that he ca n't hear he overcame that obstacle with his drum playing 	 Hmm I might start to like this band more now
I liked Holding on to Good 	 Yeah that 's a good one I think my favorite was Hey Hey Hey
Yeah I caught it when it first came out 	 I watch it every time it 's on tv
It is definitely scandalous but not in the way you would assume 	 Really
They are one of those timeless rock bands that you can imagine their music being played long after they 're gone 	 Oh I know like Wild Horses wild horses could n't drag me awayyyy
No I have not 	 I suggest you watch my favorite movie
I do too 	 I think that it is good they had their quarterback because of tony romo and him not being able to play
She has written songs for Justin Bieber Selena Gomez and Britney Spears 	 What That 's insane
And also a lot of other Disney movies like Up 	 Man I really think I need to watch more animations
I 'll send you some of their stuff 	 Okay thanks so much
So what do you think of Bruno Mars 	 I would have to be a teenaged girl to answer that question
would be the Falcons offensively dominant team Julio Ryan great backfield 	 I might disagree you with you there and say the PAckers
I love my sister I ca n't imagine not having her in my life I would feel horrible if we had to be separated 	 I probably would too had I a sister I do know what love feels like that 's pretty universal
And creepily 	 On Saturday i will see something funny
The lynard skinner band 	 There pretty good but I also like allman brothers
Yeah i think that 's a good call 	 Where is the Hall of Fame located
Well they 're Disney movies They 're about a bunch of appliances looking for their master 	 What on earth that sounds bizarre
Yeah I saw Arrival recently 	 Cool what 's it about
Yeah but that injury pretty much killed their shot 	 Who do you think will win it all
That movie was so silly 	 That 's why I liked it
Oh I have n't seen that one yet 	 It is really good And another one that incoporates songs throughout the movie
Who 's your favorite player 	 Probably Lou Williams he 's pretty good
They 're relevant even today 	 What do you think was their most powerful song
That sounds like something I 'd like 	 Probably I 've discovered it 's really tough to find artists that do classical stuff that I like
Fair enough 	 They 're touring I 'm definitely going to see them live
No but I do n't think it was supposed to 	 How do you mean
Yes the love boat 	 Your funny.so when do you want to get started
I guess it 's worth noting that we 've been talking about American folk music but many nations and peoples have a tradition of folk music 	 That makes sense I can remember going to a Greek Festival and listening to Greek music that might have been folk music
So are they making a movie based on the new book 	 I think they are
I remember him 	 It got me thinking about life
You 're right the Celtics and Lakers spent decades tormenting the rest of the league 	 Exactly let these two teams enjoy their time in the spotlight it will be short lived
Where is that 	 Tennessee
Cross-dressing a dead mother and even a toilet flushing 	 Those are nothing
I think you ca n't go wrong with classic rock I remember listening to guns and roses constantly when I was growing up 	 Yes I feel that thier music is so unique I still listen to them now I never get bored of listening to them so many classic hits
That is what I 'm thinking too but I 'd like it if the Celtics made it to the finals instead of the Cavaliers 	 I 'd like to see the Spurs make it personally
I saw it too I loved it 	 I know right I did n't think I would but it is about so much
Like who 	 Gary Oldman is in at least or of them
The real singer 's name was Marni Nixon They used her in a lot of musicals 	 That 's crazy I 'm not a big fan of musicals though
I have actually I recently went to a Beyonce concert 	 Wow I bet that was unbelievable
Who is the opening game of the NFL season this year 	 Well they always open with the Super Bowl winner at home so it is Patriots and Chiefs
That 's definitely the best part of the entire movie 	 Bob ends up kicking Happy 's butt pretty good does n't he
Plus they both could fight and fly with the best 	 Yes remember Lando had some military experience and was the original owner of the Falcon
So what actor do you pick 	 Maybe the guy who plays fraiser
A lot of those actors went on to have great movie careers 	 My favorite was Ally Sheedy
I bet What was the crowd like 	 Very loud actually I could hardly hear the band
I do as well do n't you think they set it up for there to be a third movie 	 For sure they did now he has the whole world after him since he crossed the continental owner
There are so many reasons the way he looks and the way he talks are two of them 	 I have never really liked Yoda
he is quite good 	 yeah hope the second one is as good or even better
Yes with his background and J.J. Watt I think their chances are good 	 Well I hope they make the super bowl and you are happy
Hey the song day in the life from the Beatles was n't played in England until like 	 Really Why is that
Yeah and it was acted in a way that didnt feel fake 	 Yeah this was a good film when you think about it
I am going to watch it tonight 	 I am interested in knowing where it goes
Wow sounds intense 	 It is but just seeing all those amazing creatures is super worth it
Yeah fine When 's the next game 	 Monday the 22nd It 's in Oakland
The Nuremberg defendants were tried for war crimes like shooting unarmed prisoners and crimes against humanity like killing millions of civillians 	 You mean the Jews in concentration camps
Yeah I agree I 've never been a big X-Men fan but I liked seeing the school and how everything came to be 	 I agree I loved seeing Xavier 's School in a realistic movie
Try Kendrick Lamar He 's good 	 Cool who else
Yeah I like his movies 	 Did you see that one with him and Denzel
So the real hero of these movies is Hagrid 	 Well you know you could say so Hagrid is the one who gets Harry to Hogwarts in the first place and he helps them all through the story
really 	 yeah it fell flat it could have done a lot but it was very shallow
How do you think the harry potter movies compared to the books 	 I think overall they did a really good job with the basic plot but they could have done better in some of the finer details
Pepe Serna 	 Sounds interesting
I love nowhere man It always reminded me of Bob Dylan 	 Lyrically I can see that
I would love to see some of these people in concert Especially George Strait I love his PURE COUNTRY CD 	 I would too that would be fun
everyplace we went that song was playing 	 wow it must have been popular
Me too 	 Do you think non-religious people will like it
What horror movie was the funniest you have seen 	 I would say krampus
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
Yes that scene is definitely up there for me as well 	 I feel as if that was the scene where Heath Ledger really captured The Joker
So you liked them 	 My eyes were glued to the TV the whole time
I like a broken heart 	 Thats a great song too
Wow sounds like a weird movie 	 It is want to know what its about
Good Maybe we could work on a list together and then I could share it with you 	 I like that idea I have a few more suggestions
Yes is is truly unique 	 Ok I like that
It is so worth it though The entire movie is cheap the frame rate is even something like three frames per second because they run out of money 	 That just sounds despicable
How did you feel about Han Solo 's death 	 I understood why it happened but there will be a real hole in the sequels without Harrison 's charisma
I cant believe you didnt show any emotion 	 Disney always does a good job at almost getting me there
Yeah feet He crushed that ball 	 I did n't think that ball was ever coming down
I do n't usually like animated films but that one was pretty good 	 Have you seen Baywatch yet
People really got that offended by that 	 Yes Christian communities really got upset and the Beatles even got death threats
No it 's all in English I actually held off on checking them out for a while because I thought that metal lyrics in French would sound kind of goofy 	 Who else have you been listening to
no sweat if you wanta go i got you 	 yes i would like to go who 's with them playing
A lot of musicians cite them as being hugely influential 	 What 's amazing is that they only put out two albums in their entire early career People think of them as this huge force in the late 's but they were n't even around that long and then they broke up in
I think that was great as well 	 He was such a terrific performer its a shame hes not making new music
A bunch of hits or a bunch of albums 	 I think there were at least several albums but she had a bunch of hits
We should go this weekend and see it I was planning to watch it again anyway 	 Okay let 's go Are there any handsome guys in the movie
She got herself a 	 And she also got a shorty
That is obviously how it turned out.Even greater than the league could have hoped 	 Football is now king It has n't even been close for the last years Baseball is a distant number
Yup That 's just how she is 	 That 's kind of weird I 'm not going to lie
Yes there is a stage show She dances a lot and there are back up dancers as well and a nice stage setting 	 I have not heard of her until now
Why do you like them 	 I live in Indiana and got to see Peyton Manning 's whole career here
Oh I think they are an amazing band 	 Why do you say so
Agreed Well it was nice talking to you 	 Same to you
He was so good So tragic that he had to die Him and Tupac both 	 I like that Puff Daddy wrote a song for Biggie
That would be a wonderful to get anything to watch and it 's free 	 One of my favorite things was each employee was asked to pick out two of their favorite movies and put the whole collection on display
Yeah I would say so 	 What is it about them that you like
Ok so you really enjoyed it 	 Yes it was super funny
That will be devastating He will have Gronkowski and Cooks they will be frustrating teams once again 	 If I had to pick I think Brown then Beckham then Cooks then Hill for most touchdowns this year in that order
Who 's in it though 	 James Stewart Kim Novak Ernie Kovacs Jack Lemmon and the perfectly named Hermione Gingold
Me too I have a lot of her music downloaded onto my phone 	 You just do not hear voices like hers
They 're a punk/emo band from the 90s They 're from the San Francisco Bay Area sound they played shows with Green Day and Nirvana back in the day but broke up after signing to a major label 	 What happened Why were n't they huge like NOFX or Rancid
Maybe so I have kids so I appreciate the fact that I can listen to music with them that sounds decent and contains clean content 	 That guy thinks he 's a rapper He sucks
Yes It is confusing now though because Frozen and Moana are in the same animation style but they are just Disney not Pixar 	 I guess I did n't realize that
They all run together self-serving boring 	 You probably wo n't be joining his fan club I take it
I would love to play a hockey game with you sometime 	 That would be fun Have you every played before
No 	 I have n't either but like to watch the games
The NFL is just another time and patience situation for Philly fans so I know that Howie Roseman gets what he is doing as the GM 	 I always wanted to be lucky enough to attend a game in various stadiums any interest in picking a city or two this season
It was very close game just like half of the games last season 	 Our defense sucks so bad I 'm really losing hope that we will win another SuperBowl
Who is your favorite Star Wars character 	 I 'll have to think about that one for a minute Who 's yours
I have never heard of him before 	 You should check him out His early songs are some of my favorite rap songs
Schwarber will get going Although I personally do n't know if he will ever be that superstar that his bat has the potential to be I think he will be a solid WAR guy Just no superstar 	 Schwarber has time to become an elite player and him playing left can be fine But I 'm not seeing passable defense yet am I wrong
They went four years in a row and lost them all 	 Ouch Was the the early '90s
They are doing their usual surge which is impressive to be honest 	 The Cubs and Red Sox have been slow to start
Wow that was an awesome movie Ben Affleck was great in it 	 Yeah he was You know what other movie I really like him in
Are you ready for some football 	 Yes I ca n't wait I really hope the Rams do good this season
Think we will win the division 	 Well it 's a weak division so there 's a chance
yeah he was spitting so much 	 i like the new bring me the horizon though
It 's OK I called in to work and just played video games and watched movies all day 	 Oh yeah What movies
Not much 	 What stars wars movie is your least favorite
Well first off the Chargers only have a year approval to relocate They are required to negotiate with the Rams on a new stadium 	 Well the Rams are n't going anywhere then
Would I know any of their songs 	 I 'm sure you would They did Daydream Believer and I 'm a Believer to name two
haha 	 She is my favorite
Who was your favorite character 	 Tow Mater for sure Who do you like
He was funny in it 	 I should see it
Well do yourself a favor and do n't They do not hold up well at all 	 Okay good to know
Do you plan on watching the new one 	 Yes i cant wait to see it
Do you like the rapper Danny Brown 	 Not really His voice is so odd
Yeah maybe But what if it makes you more likely to be violent by rewarding the enjoyment of violence 	 I had n't thought of that but I enjoy ice hockey it 's fast paced and fun
I wish I could go on a road trip like that 	 I have been on one and it was fun not with my parents though
One of my all time favorites was Sixty Eight Guns 	 So they have an upbeat tempo
It was a very good movie 	 I saw it times
Oh I love it 	 Wait you mean the NFL right
Yeah I always liked the Battle Hymn of the Republic 	 That is amazing
I completely agree 	 Squeeze me in is a great song
Yeah theres some things I did not like 	 Like what
Me too and did you hear a sequel is coming out called Glass 	 Really I had no idea
In the fifties they were not too great though and have had their ups and downs through the years 	 Yes I guess so
Yep His stuff is good for working reading exercising you name it 	 He 'll be on my beach playlist for sure
Anyway with the new movie I liked the direction quite a bit 	 I heard that it was done quite compellingly
Did you like anything about it 	 Yes I still enjoyed the movie Also Daisy Ridley is just a phenomenal actress
Is he the frontman of the band 	 He certainly is He is the singer He also produces music for other bands
Was it as good as the original trilogy 	 I ca n't answer that without divulging into spoilers
I did once last year Would you be interested in going if they came to town 	 Definitely I know most of their songs
what are you grilling smells great 	 Pork hops and corn on the cob
Do you like her better as a mermaid or human 	 Mermaid of course
That sounds kind of scary 	 Some metal is actually pretty tame and melodic
Sure John Lennon Paul McCartney George Harrison and Ringo Starr 	 Do you know who was the youngest
One of the biggest comebacks ever 	 I really love watching Brady
That 's who Wonder Woman is She really cares about people 	 Well I 'm officially a Wonder Woman fan now Do you know if they 're coming out with a sequel
Yes and they are still touring now 	 I thought that the lead singer passed away did n't he
I like some of his stuff 	 But not all of it
Their style is appealing to a lot 	 Its rock but not so much that those that like pop do n't listen to it
Yes funny and fantastic music 	 I know Aretha Franklin James Brown Ray Charles
I think Sidney Crosby needs to retire 	 Me too he has to consider his health
They fit the expanded storyline but I still kind of like the old stuff better 	 I know what you mean It was cool to see a bit more backstory
That 's an odd question 	 Well it 's because we all know who the best is
They should do well I like Green Bay 	 Everybody does at the beginning of the season I have to wonder if it 's just Aaron Rodgers and other guys
Yes I am seen all of them at least times each 	 I still have not seen one Star Wars movie to this day
That was sneaky That should n't have counted 	 Isaiah Thomas hook shot from outside the court behind the backboard
That does all sound like America When did it come out 	 That 's the amazing thing It came out in which is now twenty years ago but it is still super relevant
When I was in college 	 It is that old
Oh man you 're going to love it it 's produced by Brian Fallon 	 Wait you mean the Brian Fallon of The Gaslight Anthem
No it came out years and years ago 	 Who was in it Anyone well known
I do n't think I had ever heard of it 	 I had n't either I wanted to watch Wonder Woman but arrived late
oh I remember that song he keeps calling Guala guala right 	 yes it 's so funny
And well-deserved too I thought about turning it off 	 Why did n't you
it all boils down now to Fred if he would also love the idea to skip pub and also watch Kong 	 just hold on a bit let me just fill him in about the new arrangement be right back
I can not wait to see him and Spiderman have a funny conversation 	 Do you think they will keep this actor as Spiderman for a while
I guess he did some quick thinking 	 Did it look real in the movie when the plane went down
I know I started watching on a weekly basis in and considered myself a diehard fan until the second playoff loss to Pittsburgh 	 How are they looking this year
No it is a type of music 	 Well I feel dumb
Yea the way they slow-motion dodged bullets was really cool 	 Yea it was
Chasing Pavements She released it as Adele Adkins 	 I remember that I do n't think I know anything else off of that first album
Its just a cool electronic festival that gathers people in Belgium from all around the world 	 Sounds really cool please tell me more about it
Sage the Gemini and Boldy James come to mind 	 I 'll give them a listen
And do n't forget I 'll Make a Man Out of You by Donny Osmond 	 Oh yeah that one 's fun to sing along with
Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time 	 Pinocchio for sure
That will make money I 'm sure 	 It might even win a few awards
Have you seen salt 	 No but i always wanted to
No it 's by Julia Michaels 	 Oh I though it was Arianna Grande
That is also a great song 	 Everytime I hear them I feel so good
Yeah me too How is the newest album 	 It 's good but it feels like they are trying to reach a wider audience
I loved it because it taught me about a different culture and just felt different from most other movies 	 How was it different from other movies
I probably would really like it then because I like songs that make you feel good 	 Yeah that would be on my top favorite list for sure
I did n't see hi kill anyone 	 Not directly But the people he branded for instance
I am not surprised to hear that People speak very highly of him in magazines and on TV 	 I wonder who he will get behind next
Paper Gangsta and the Fame 	 I have n't heard Paper Gangsta
Do you want to bet on it 	 Fifty dollars says the Celtics will wrap it up Friday night
They were mostly cover bands they did a lot of 's and 's rock covers 	 That sounds like a bunch of fun I love old rock music
That would be a game to see 	 Yes but the Browns will get killed in that game
Right I used to have my sister write out the lyrics for me because back then it was only dial-up Internet 	 Oh my gosh we are so old
You do n't like them at all 	 I 'm a fair weather fan I only have an interest if they are in the play offs
True How about Halo by Beyonc√© then 	 Oh that 's perfect
I really liked The Mist 	 What 's that about
they did a very good job 	 i wonder if we will see them a lot more
Defense got some help 	 What do you mean
That is a catchy song 	 For sure
Yeah you are probably right 	 Have you ever been to a music concert
Do you like heavy music 	 Like Slipknot
No I did n't I wish I did though was it good 	 It was amazing I always love the X-Men series Logan is definitely one of my favorite science fictions
I loved that when it came out 	 How old were you
I think so He has a really interesting arc in the first one 	 I agree the way he goes from a non caring space pirate to a friend is awesome
Have you heard the new remastered Sgt. Pepper 's album 	 Yeah it 's great
How so 	 Well they were such gray characters They were n't Sith but they were n't rebels either They acted only on what would give them the most benefit and money of course
Definitely They need to go back to the Han who shot Greedo first instead of the Han that George Lucas tried to sanitize 	 I heard Donald Glover is in the movie playing a young Lando Calrissian
Who have you seen in concert that you 've liked 	 I went to an amazing Barry Manilow concert back in the day He puts on a great show
You mean Baby Boy 	 Yeah that 's the one
Do you like the original Thor 	 Yes it is different
Not especially why 	 Just wondering
I just do n't like his depiction in the third movie 	 My ultimate favorite in the marvel genre is xmen
I love Bruce Springsteen 	 I can not stand Bruce Springsteen
I belive they can be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame soon if not already 	 Yeah I think you have to wait years from a first record release
I love Optimus Prime He is my favorite character 	 The first Transformers in had Shia LaBeouf in it
Well I hope they are 	 Me too I just love Tim Burton
They had a great guitarist Johnny Marr 	 I love a good guitar solo
That 's surprising coming out of you 	 I have a new respect for him
Strange how two people can be so close and make such amazing music and then break up 	 Yeah they used to have such a positive energy and spark about them
All of them 	 You cant Pick all of them
Yes it is a great resource for TV shows and Movies this original Netflix film bieng bad is not common 	 Who was in Sandy Wexler
It 's sad how much I miss an actor I 've never met 	 Yea movies can make you feel like you know a person well
Do you think the Warriors might be able to sweep the Cavs this year 	 The Warriors are a great team but Lebron and Cavs should be able to win a few games maybe even the series
Yeah I can see how you would get that out of the song 	 I also love the song Shake it Off I know it 's more pop than rock but it 's really inspiring since we were on the topic
Who do you think will win the MVP award this year 	 Derek Carr will probably win it based on how much they missed him last year and how much hell improve this year
Like the Abbey Road album 	 Exactly Here Comes the Sun just makes me smile I love that song
A ticket food and a drink can cost almost 	 Well we could save that money and stay in
I know that 's what makes it fun 	 Ok so I 'll go with Baymax Moana Thor Captain America and Anna from Frozen
I would say it 's Michael Jackson 	 Why is it Michael Jackson
You mean like Phantom Menace and all those Yeah I like them 	 They 're not my favorite movies What did you like about them
Why 's that 	 Well he is a white rapper in a predominately black ruled genre of music
Sounds fun 	 Yeah the music videos for some of his songs are pretty histerical too
He only made TWO shots all game and had like turnovers 	 -LCB- -RCB-
I think they 'll end up going to seven games Neither team seems to be able to win on the road 	 -LCB- -RCB-
I know it 's so sad 	 Yeah but does n't this happen to every boyband anyway
Exactly like Soulja Boy he is retarded I ca n't believe he sold even one album 	 Definitely and that song Pretty Boy Swag is not exactly Nas or Tupac
That is WAY to old to play professional football 	 Agreed
It is Do n't you remember what song we played at my sisters memorial 	 Was n't it Brown Eyed Girl
I will be sure to come and watch that game with you this year 	 That will be a lot of fun I 've never been to an game in person yet
The music landscape is so different anyway most people are listening and discovering on Spotify 	 Yeah but there 's so many artists on there that a good rock band will get lost in the shuffle
That was like a horror film right 	 Yes he does suspense really well
It would I do n't think Lasseter did the storyline though 	 I like Lasseter films If someone else directed it I doubt Flash would win his big race Have you ever ridden in a Tesla
Tom Brady is worth a lot of money but he takes a lower salary for the team 	 Yeah at some point people just have enough money and want to win
The Disney cartoon Yeah 	 Do you know how old that cartoon was
I think the film really showed another side to genre that not all heroes are super or even always heroes 	 I think it made just enough fun of people like Batman that it made the characters seem real
Burial is the pioneering artist of Future Garage music It features scattered broken beats dark bass-lines and soulful vocals 	 Sound pretty interesting
But the Panther 's offensive line is so bad 	 Yeah but he can catch passes too
Yeah she is I like brunettes 	 Me too
Hello 	 Hi
Good nice to meet you 	 have you seen the new Twin Peaks
Acoustic guitar 	 Oh cool I did n't know your boyfriend was a musician

They have several great songs that I think you will get into 	 I sure hope so for my wife 's sake
i am saying hello but as a color 	 Weird
Taylor Swift ans Shania Twain to name a few 	 OK but they got out of country That proves it not good music if even its stars want out of the genre when they get popular
Right Who you going for this year 	 I have to stick with Tampa Bay Buccaneers
The Beatles are obviously one of the greatest music groups in history 	 Then there 's Queen who helped bring rock music to the mainstream
I agree I was fascinated by how Jordan Peele used the trappings of traditional horror films to comment on race relations 	 Oh that 's an interesting take on it What are you referring to
I do n't know her but I want to see all the old Bellas 	 They have some wacky scenes like a synchronized swimming pool scene
Oh that is a very funny movie 	 Have you seen the second one
She is a great actress 	 She is
No way were they innocent 	 Care to clarify
Nice I actually just bought an Antoine Boldin jersey for cheap when he was on the Cardinals 	 Great buy I want to see it
I like Boys Round Here What about you 	 I think it is probably Mine Would Be You
Did n't the shark have a name in the movie 	 Yes the name was Bruce
Did you know Disney films have been around for almost years now 	 Wow has it really been that long
It was an interesting plot twist 	 Have you seen the other movies that have come out in the rebooted universe
What is that about again Is that the one with Santa and all female elves 	 No A Christmas Story is the movie with a little boy who wants a BB Gun for Christmas but his parents are hesitant because they think he 'll shoot his eye out
What is your favorite story-line heading into the season 	 I am looking forward to seeing if the Oakland Raiders can continue to improve

Nelly is a good artist 	 Yea his hot in here song was great
Not as good as the first one 	 Yeah it was n't very good
He also did a lot for others off the field too 	 Well I hope your Dolphins make you happy this year
I mean football I.Q. he had the arm and the speed but could not go through his progressions 	 I agree That was a poor decision not to mention York meddling when he had no experience
A-wa is awesome so is omer adam and moshe peretz 	 who is your absolute favorite

I like the Detroit Lions 	 Oh man that sucks to be you
Snow White is my favorite She is the fairest of them all 	 I am not a Snow White fan Do you just like her or are you a fan of the movie as well

How about for a power hitter who leads the league in batting 	 If that were the case I would say
She also does n't seem to be the type of person that would go watch a playback of a performance So if that 's true she might really not know 	 There was that theory at the VMAs that she was singing live at the end which is why she switched to a hand held mic
I wonder if there is any good music now like Mozzart 	 That is highly doubtful
what movies 	 Yes
His music was so influential throughout my life 	 Mine too I fell in love with Temple of the Dog
You may be right I often find myself loving the first of any series I think it 's due to the introduction and backstory coming to life 	 Plus in superhero movies a lot of times you see them transform into their power which is pretty neat
Well they are sisters bound to sound a little alike 	 I am actually surprised how much I enjoy her songs
I wish people would briing that style back to counrty music 	 I know country music today is more rock with a tad of country thrown in
What Are you kidding 	 Nope not at all
I agree But have you been to one of their games 	 Yes And it was pretty good but they lost
He did n't see it but yes he LOVED the game 	 What do you mean
Hm I do n't know Maybe something like While you were sleeping or Santa Clause with Tim Allen 	 Also there was Hook That one is one of my favorites its a classic
Well Yeah I 've heard those songs they are classics but I did n't know who sang them 	 That is Garh Brooks
I really like the more pop-like songs like Yellow Submarine 	 Me too
Because Gorillaz is a collaborative band It has an ever-changing group of contributing artists and no particular set-in-stone sound It is meant to be somewhat fluid 	 I see what you mean
There was a missed PAT Minnesota scored again but it was too late 	 The Vikings had not luck in the Superbowl
Was their defense good last year 	 Not really if their defense was better they could have won the Super Bowl
Oh you must trust me your heart will soar If you loved the animation you will fall in love with this too 	 If you say so Is the music all the same
Yes that 's tough to do but I like his talent 	 He keeps the fans on their toes

I agree 	 Their live shows were killer
I agree I think it has the best shoot outs out of any other movie 	 Right Every shoot out lasts for a really long time and every moment is heart pounding action
You know what 's interesting Superheroes 	 Not particularly All major cultures have long running myths about superhumans doing good for the mankind
I ca n't deny it It will be a welcome addition to my thriller collection 	 What did you like most about it
Yeah Even though the airpods themselves suck the commercial is still pretty cool 	 Did n't that air during the superbowl
I 'll be sure to give those a listen 	 I do n't think you 'll regret it
Trying to keep us stupid and wanting to be with their kind Like there is something wrong with us being with our own kind 	 I did n't think about it that way
Yea I think they used both 2D and 3D animation to pull that off 	 Really
It has the eerie similarity to the original 	 Oh well I will still go see it
Yeah this Cleveland team and Lebron are rolling 	 I just wish they had some competitive games
Yeah Too bad DC has n't figured out the formula yet 	 Right Suicide Squad and Batman V Superman were disappointing
Never heard of it all I know is that song Because I Got High 	 Ha that 's a good one too I was gon na clean my room but then I got high
Well Schenker himself refused as he is racist 	 Really
But it 's so loud 	 It 's supposed to be This was Chris Cornell back in the 's his vocals were amazing
Yes but when a movie brings you to tears especially as a child you tend to remember it 	 That 's true Bambi did that to me His poor mother well we know what happened to her
I think so it is really upbeat 	 Great do you have any other suggestions
She has such great live performances though 	 I would love to go to one of her concerts
He was n't a very good example and I think he paid for it with his life 	 That was brutal but an apt metaphor for the horrible things that happen to people for no good reason
Plus guys are singles hitters now 	 So you think the hitters have evolved

He kept it so real while paying respect to his mom 	 Do you think tupac was violent
So who 's your favorite old school rapper 	 Biggie smalls dude had some sick flow
Ya I did n't see many commercials for it But remember the poster 	 Well you should see it it was a great movie
Maleficent is evil incarnate but as a fairie as were Ja'Far is evil as a Genie or Jin 	 I think that Maleficent is more protective of what she believes to be hers
It 's a tradition Besides wooden bats make so much better sound when it hits the ball not like aluminum bat which that high pitched metallic sound 	 So amateurs are allowed to use aluminum
I am concerned though that the Penguins have a couple of injuries 	 Yeah it is a little alarming but someone else always seems to set up
How could it get old 	 I mean it was funny when it came out because I was a teenager After a while it was lame
Which is your favorite character other than Mulan 	 I would have to say Mushu he is very funny indeed
I am joking 	 Are you sure
I 'm glad you can see it that way even if it 's not your type of music 	 If it makes you happy I support it
You 're not serious are you 	 What My brother knows what I like to wear
So it 's only in Korea though right 	 Actually it has large audiences in Japan Canada The US and South America
Is n't that just like a charming scoundrel 	 And right when things were getting interesting here comes Threepio to interrupt
Yeah but they are still holding onto the original cast 	 So you want C3PO out too You are nuts

-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
Oh lordy 	 Know who those quick songs of sorts modulate by a half step each time
When they end up getting all the money thanks to Matt Damon 's mom in the movie that was hilarious 	 I know You are right Who else co-stars with Matt Damon
They did some good work with other films so there is hope 	 Yea and Keanu Reeves would help make the movie good
So what 's more exciting the inside-the-parker or the little-leaguer 	 I like the inside-the-park because it 's less on human error minus a judgement call and more about a massive sprint
no he is doing ok 	 not winning is not ok
What do you think it 's about 	 I 'm not sure I heard it 's quite a few years in the future after Luke and Vader
No disrespect to Manning but I do n't think he holds a candel to Elway 	 Why do you say that

I never pictured him being played by Johnny Depp 	 Yeah but I think it works
Does it seem like they are pulling from mixed cds 	 Oh yeah the album covers seem to be mixes from cds I assume you could buy

Yeah it will probably take a something awful to happen before they move him 	 Did you make your Superbowl reservation yet
What was your least favorite Star Wars movie 	 I would say Episode one
Is n't he the mascot for the 49ers 	 He is
What about Jay Cutler How many yards did he have 	 He had about so it was n't too far from Osweiler
Apparently Brad Pitt did n't like the direction the movie went 	 Which is strange really He read the script right
I love the beat I could clean house to it all day 	 Who sings it
Did he sing that really old but very famous song On the Road Again 	 Yes he did My dad always played that song when we took road trips
What is your favorite album by them 	 I love the Red Album
In what sense 	 Chronologically its tough because there are so many comics
Right It would eliminate and deter that aspect totally 	 Resulting in less stampedes to get to their parked cars and a lot less manic
Awesome I look forward to hearing that band play 	 Cool the bigger the crowd the better
He is such a great actor 	 Yeah he is and the guy who frees him is played by Christoph Waltz
Yeah but Cleveland went in there last month and beat them by 	 True and San Antonio does n't seem healthy in the West
I think that the comeback was pretty epic and also inspiring 	 Yeah it was a great comeback I thought Patriots were lost already
You think so 	 Yeah like dance music reels and jigs and things That 's the root of bluegrass and it 's what makes it different
Neat That means he 's used to making things with a more dark and serious tone 	 Definitely I hope Last Jedi turns out like Empire Strikes Back its my favorite
Your e such a dork 	 Yes but the question stands
Action films have violence and strong heroes while thrillers have suspense and innocents in jeopardy Is Taken action or suspense 	 That 's easy All three Taken movies are both they are action thrillers
Oh that always confused me 	 Probably because one of the characters was named Ray
They deflate balls 	 Not proven
I also like Zeke with cowboys 	 zeke is a beast You know who else is a beast
Oh yeah How did they do that 	 They used old footage and had a body double
I think Captain America Civil War did some interesting things with rivals 	 Yea Ironman was really killing it with his suit and one liners
Exactly Die alone in a ship where there was another person right next to you the whole time 	 Yea I do n't know The situation still felt uncomfortable
Okay yeah so it 's the Peter Jackson ones 	 Oh yeah Those ones I 've been watching those ones
They are cute I feel no other star wars movie has that aspect in them 	 Well I think they tried to do another cute funny character with Jar Jar Binks but that flopped
What else 	 I like the Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up
Probably Free Lunch or Silkk da Shocka 	 I liked that album and Free Lunch is my favorite song as well
Yeah they lost their QB at the wrong moment last year 	 Hopefully he 's healed up and ready to go
MAY BE I CAN GO WITH YOU NEXT TIME 	 YES I WILL LOVE THAT I NO YOU WILL LOVE HER
Pineda 	 How 'd he do
So who are going to be your top picks this year for the draft 	 Oh definitely members of the patriots if I can like brady gronkowski edelman
that songs is so dark and depressing 	 i think its about suicide or something

That does sound nice How was Derbez as an actor 	 He was great He and Salma have wonderful chemistry so it was nice to watch how natural they were on screen together
Like whom 	 Take No Doubt for example
I 'd seen it a lot growing up 	 I always wanted to skip school like that when I was young
What record label released it 	 I am not sure I just know that I did n't like it
How so 	 If you look at his previous season outside of his Superbowl season he really has n't had that great of a career
No I did not 	 That is unfortunate because it is great
Gotcha Who is your favorite player 	 I like James Harden you
Where is Dwight Howard from I 'd never heard of him until the NBA 	 He played for the Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy He was an unknown until the NBA snapped him up
I really liked the part with the mushrooms and how Luigi was sure they were telling them something 	 Yeah me too
He played for the Berlin Thunder 	 Any Steelers
I agree I think she has a fantastic voice though 	 She 's a great singer but I do n't think her voice works for country music
Actually it was originally done by a group called The Andrew Sisters 	 Looks like Big Band music had a lot of upbeat songs
Yeah he really made some class movies back in the day 	 Shame he 's so terrible now
What does Adele bring 	 She brings realism and emotion to her music You ca n't help but get sunk into her songs
There are people out there that thank her for things that she has nothing to do with 	 Give me an example
The last one Or did they do one for the current movie 	 I do n't remember if they did one for the current movie but I was thinking of the last movie
No he did n't That 's the part I did n't like all his work on the movie and he dies only his kids get saved and to like who knows where with some aliens 	 For what it sounds it sounds kinda off Who else is the movie
Hey I almost did n't hear you I was listening to music 	 It 's no problem at all What are you listening to

Yeah that was n't quite as good as Appetite For Destruction but I still liked it 	 Yes I agree Who was in the band aside from Axl Rose
He was killing the ball but now he stinks 	 He 's had at-bats Relax

I did n't care for it that much actually 	 Why did n't you like it
oh about once a month 	 Do you like their new home field
I think they made a movie together 	 They do n't the bounty hunter in
Jean 	 The will be leader
Really I would n't have guessed 	 Is that sarcastic
Maybe the move to Las Vegas will alleviate that a bit 	 Maybe I do n't know if Vegas is the best place for them
Hello I want to see a good movie which one do you recommend 	 What type of movie do you want to see
Yeah I do n't like the soft romantic stuff 	 It 's a pretty fast paced movie
That was a Nokia phone Nokia 	 People actually used that phone in real life
Well I never really skated but I 'd love to give it a try 	 Maybe by next playoff season you 'll be skating like a pro
Yeah beheadings and whatnot 	 Hmmm not sure if I 'd like that one
We lost Scott Weiland from Stone Temple Pilots too 	 We did They were a good band but I do n't know if I consider them legendary
Oh yes I thought she did a great job 	 She did I feel she made the character believable
I had heard it once before then but I feel the same way I 'm undecided 	 What was up with that kid dancing in her Saturday Night Live performance
Oh I know what you are talking about with regards to 	 Yes that And Numb really brings back memories of that time in my life and the positive things that happened

Yes that was a good one also 	 Can you imagine getting blamed for something you did n't do
I liked that too 	 What was your favorite song
Yeah he 's a great actor I wonder what year the movie was taking place in 	 It was so we are n't there yet

Do you know how to play any instrumenst 	 Yes i can play the guitar
It 's his long-lost brother 	 Let me guess also a villain
He had a few joints but nothing that really sticks out 	 Yeah thank God for the internet we can hear his banger on demand
I know believe me I know 	 Well lets just hope this is the year to take it all the way
Why are you bored 	 I be needing something to do
The band gets paid every time that happens do n't they 	 Yes indeed The companies have to license the song and give the band money
I bet you 'd probably love his Symphonie path√©tique his sixth symphony 	 What 's so cool about it
That would be cool but I Think they need to wrap it up 	 In what sense
Even the Lucas prequel movies The first three 	 No not those But I 've enjoyed what I 've seen since Disney took over
Oh really What Disney movies do you think I 'd like then 	 The movies made during the Disney Renaissance would pique your interest I think
I cried when I saw it I did n't expect to be so moved but I was 	 Me too everything my husband said he felt about the original Star Wars was sort of how I felt about The Force Awakens
That 's because did n't want to seem like he sold out to his original fan base 	 Well UGK is still better than Outkast
Of course it is Dark Horse 	 Has Adam Lambert had any new music out lately
Really What did the article say 	 Well he 's thrown already in his year career so far
Are you going to go see Cars 	 Yes I 've been waiting for it to come out
How many teams does it have 	 It has four teams altogether
I like Frozen for its emotional content and the way sister bond was shown between Anna and Elsa 	 Elsa was the younger one right
I think it tends to be more popular than music man 	 I do love so many song in music man hard call
No I have n't how many have there been now 	 That is the eighth one came out not too long ago
I also like how the girls in the village braid Rapunzel 's hair shortly before that 	 That is a cute scene with Flynn and Rapunzel dancing with the villagers
Did you know there is a Star Wars coming out I saw the trailer 	 Is it coming out in
Yeah exactly They had a ceremony to retire his number 	 How long ago did he retire
Yeah Mainly in the scene with the wolves 	 Oh okay I do remember then looking fake but I did n't really mind
Really How was it 	 We loved it It was better than the second Cars movie
Who is your favorite band of all time 	 Oh definitely thousand foot krutch
Do n't you think they are worried that kids will stop playing football 	 No There will always be football It is americas favorite sport
Yeah but its baseball without a cap it makes no sense 	 Well maybe they dont want to commit to him
Korean pop music It 's quite popular these days 	 I 'll have to check it out What bands are worth listening to
Another good one is a documentary about baseball 	 What is it called
Well they 're good ca n't deny it 	 That 's high praise
She is a new country singer She is somewhat similar to Miranda Lambert and Kacey Musgraves 	 Oh I like both of them a lot What are some of her big songs
Yes It was so unexpected 	 I was sad that Sebastian dies
What about teams who intentionally lose 	 That 's a rarity If in a competitive sport it 's found people intentionally lose they just flat out should n't be paid
No doubt But they pitched hit and defended better than everyone else last year They earned it 	 I heard the Cubs let Dexter Fowler go the Cardinals
Okay well that 's a relief 	 You ca n't go wrong with Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow
Yes i remember him he sand dirt road as well right 	 yes he did its a good song too
You should watch all JIm Carrey 's movies the 	 I agree
I do n't think they could replace such a classic character 	 That 's true I guess they 'll just have to figure something out
I feel like it would be a lot better than the new star wars movies they keep making 	 Yeah I do n't like the new actors they keep getting It would be nice to see more of Yoda
Yeah he single handedly ruined the Phanton Menace 	 Only a character as moronic as Jar Jar could ruin a movie with Darth Maul
I know LA traffic right 	 Totally Some people listen to podcasts in the car
I think so I 'm not a fan either but enjoyed it 	 What kind of music to they sing
Yes it has The exorcism also 	 ARe they making series
What about you Who would you pick 	 For me it has to be a quarterback
I guess all art has as well 	 That 's true
Really What happened 	 Unbelievable fourth quarter comeback to beat Atlanta in the Super Bowl
Yeah but it 's a year later and Father Time is still undefeated I 'd rather have the year old quarterback than the year old one 	 Whatever We 'll just agree to disagree
Mostly soft rock kind of bluesy 	 Sounds like fun
The video is rough though 	 I can not live to see it again
How do you feel about their earlier albums 	 I prefer the later albums where they experiment more but I still enjoy a lot of those pop songs on the earlier albums
Huh 	 Their relationship would be a crime in modern-day Earth She 's a queen and he 's That 's creepy

The defense will be better too 	 Why
What is a comedy he was in recently 	 He was in the entire Hangover franchise
I like everything on that album 	 I like the Boomerang soundtrack
Speaking of animatronics I miss Major Magics 	 Beatles covers and excellent pizza plus Skeeball
Outside of old defunct teams where would you put a modern franchise 	 Oregon maybe New Mexico Oklahoma
He 'll do well with the Giants 	 I think so too
Well they wound up forming the band they are in now Forever in your Mind 	 That 's incredible
i 'm not sure I think she was only in No Doubt 	 Well who else do you like then

Great topic 	 Do you like destinys child
Yeah even Ringo 	 I actually think George Harrison was the most talented
Why was she worth so much money 	 You do n't plan on seeing the movie If I told you it would spoil things
I know just what you mean I did the same thing 	 The sequal is n't too bad either
They keep rebuffing the cast so probably not 	 Cant you see them branching into the Marvel Cinematic Universe
That 's the problem they 're there just to have some cuddly cute creatures and sell toys and not to add anything to the plot At least that 's my opinion 	 The battle scene near the end of Return of the Jedi was pretty great though right
Do you think she will have her daughter in a video again soon 	 Yes and maybe the twins also
have you watched the nba lately 	 not really why
You know I 'm not sure Mets maybe 	 Oh okay
Kind of is n't fair that they had a great team and added Kevin Durant 	 Yeah the NBA is kind of always that way one or two teams are stacked and everyone else is mediocre
Yeah but hipsters love irony 	 They do but they cant keep it up
The voices have some relatively unknown singers also I thought they were professional singers 	 Really I feel curious now

Foo Fighters 	 I have seen them a couple times
Mine is Vader 	 Hes pretty awesome
Sure so more like 	 Still that 's a lot of people
Good one I liked those too I liked Caddy Shack and Stripes too 	 Bill Murray is really funny but I hated Groundhog Day
Yes they do like The new one Despicable Me 	 Did you know that the first movie Universal produced was in
I think that people do not sit down to watch movies like that anymore 	 My own experience I do not do so
I think she would really like it This is the kind of festival that 's all about fun family style music and activities 	 Bluegrass is the kind of music people like to dance to and kids love dancing around
I think their was a second 	 Was their
I think 	 What did he die of
From home 	 Which of his movies do you find humorous
I know that man was a machine 	 The AFC dominates since I was little it 's always been an AFC team that won the superbowl
Heard you finally finished watching Harry Potter The Goblet of Fire What did you think 	 I think the movies are starting to get a little too far removed from the books What did you think
Was he involved with the classical music that was used like in the songs Yesterday and Eleanor Rigby 	 He did n't play an instrument but he conductor the orchestra
Right so league minimums can remain to sit on your butt Anyone will take that 	 The other issue I see is attendance How can they pay their players when they average fans per game
It is and I reccomend you watch it when you get the chance 	 Shrek is another great animated movie
I love Mandy Moore in it 	 She has a great clear princess voice
I was reading an article about the band 5th Harmony yesterday about why they 're not changing their name 	 Why would they want to change it anyways
What do you think of it compared to other Marvel movies 	 I liked it better than Age of Ultron but not as well as the first Avengers movie
It was mediocre He was n't really as engaging as he is in wrestling promos 	 That 's kind of normal though especially for a movie that 's in its fifth sequel already You ca n't expect much
Mine too Even in the summer 	 Ya know I have seen them with other artists too
I appreciate that I definitely want to go 	 We 've got good seats too
Two of them could play instruments when the band was formed the other two learned how to play 	 Were they successful
That 's pretty accurate The plot was better than some other movies 	 That 's what I hate about some of these movies They can be an incoherent mess
Have you heard of the band Spoon 	 Yes I listen to them occasionally They come up on my Pandora stations a lot
I heard the new theme song in the music video and it is beautiful 	 I heard there are two different version by different singers
It could be like Novemeber rain meets Perect it would rock so much 	 I would have bought that track
Three words Paint It Black 	 That 's everyone 's answer
You would think that since everyone has a youtube account now we would have a lot of pop stars 	 I think that people who get famous because of a viral video are short lived
Can you compare Anthony Kiedis vocals to someone else from that era like Chris Cornell or Eddie Vedder 	 No definitely not I do n't think Kiedis ever had a singing lesson in his life Cornell and Vedder had far superior vocals
In what way would it be relevant 	 We 'll look at the fact that Belle falls in love with The Beast goes to show that there 's more to loving someone than outwardly appearance

I 'll have to check it out 	 Pvris are releasing a brand new album called All We Know of Heaven All We Need of Hell in August of this year
Why is that 	 I think he just has more experience with movies
He was the most consistent producer on the OL during the season 	 He 's learned the calls and most of all he had to help carry poor play at both G spots for the majority of the season
Real music 	 You have to admit this song it way better than most of the noise they play on the radio today
Really Why do you say that 	 All genres had great songs and artists
There is n't another team worth thinking about 	 There are plenty of other teams worth thinking about
He really is I love most of his movies I should have guessed this one would be an irreverant cartoon 	 Yeah it was pretty irreverant Shocking really
I know Legend has it that she struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in the same inning 	 And the next day the commissioner voided her contract and declared that women were not fit to play baseball because it would take too much of a toll on their bodies or something like that
Have you been to a game lately 	 Yeah last week.why
As far as wearing red goes Lady Gaga takes the cake 	 Yes and so did Taraji P Henson wearing that Oscar de la renta gown
White 	 Oasis Lord Do n't Slow Me Down

Let me guess Everyone died in some horrific way yet the plot was able to keep moving on in spite of pivotal characters dying 	 Yeah but unlike some of his other films things still made sense but it felt lackluster compared to the types of showdowns you tend to see in other westerns
Yeah I saw that one too It was kind of fun 	 I guess I do like some of the animated movies now that we 're talking about them

Mine too 	 We should go see her

Oh man that scene gave me goosebumps 	 I got them too
It was so sad when he died 	 But Baby Groot is incredibly cute
Yeah it got poor reviews from fans and critics It does however contain over an hour of original footage So it 's worth it just for that if you 're a Matrix fan 	 So the story is deeper than Machines enslave humans and plug them into a virtual world

He did n't play much last year 	 That 's probably because he did n't know the playbook well
Oh I remember that I heard that at a Christmas concert 	 Yes it 's such a beautiful song

That was a good song is that your favorite 	 No its hail Mary
Oh she has a great voice 	 I like her yeah do you have a favorite band
Agreed and it 's wise to have a backup plan The nice thing about CDs is that so long as the player operates and we have batteries we do n't need computers or even electricity to power them 	 Right-o Old phonograph media is even better because so long as it is preserved well it will continue to play well so long as we have a sort of needle sound diaphragm and audio horn

You know the local band that plays every friday 	 Oh how much is it
Well they where formed from the large and popular group OLDMINION They had there big breakthrough in when they where signed with a label 	 So what is the style of that band
I agree that there is a lot of talent I just prefer to listen to music without the cute factor involved 	 I 'm going to put on some reggae now Talking about Bob Marley made me want to listen I think you 're right in a way The little girl does n't really have that sound
I saw the trailer and it has amazing visual effects 	 Yeah I know

The Mummy opens in the beginning of June so we can make it for then 	 Do you want to buy the tickets online
He is to old to even be playing anymore and Bill Belichick the coach needs to go 	 I so agree with that
I know but they had to make the decision they thought was best for the team 	 That obviously backfired
The music in Spike Lee 's films is always so good 	 I have n't really paid attention to it well I guess I 've only seen a few of his films

I think the original are better Plus I really liked Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher young 	 So about the new movies What do you think of Rey who is she related to
Bills 	 The Bills
I 'm sure you 're aware of the old saying that offense sells tickets and defense wins championships 	 Yeah but I 'm not sure if that still applies given all the rules changes from the past decade that tend to favor the offense
That was a classic 	 I love Baloo as Little John
Anyone else 	 Rakim
That and when Rakifi holds up baby Simba and it goes aaaaaayaaaananenenenenam 	 Nice spelling singing there I guess a new Nala and Simba could come to town and I would go watch it
That they turned this into a kids movie 	 What

He make nice things I also love Micheal Kors I love his bags 	 Who dresses better Rhianna or Beyonce
No where did he play 	 The stadium in Foxboro
He knows how to win that 's for sure 	 It 'd be interesting to see how he would do without Brady
It really was The ball went over the Green Monster so it could n't have been more perfect 	 What a lucky fan who managed to grab that ball
I do n't understand though how anyone could be kidnapped in broad daylight 	 Those girls were stupid especially the one sitting in the front seat
I think that could be said about the entire team 	 Valid point
Sell out What was wrong with their 's music 	 If you never heard their classics from the 80s I suppose Metallica 's music from the 's is OK
Those are so much fun to watch 	 Well I could take her out to see Arsenic and Old Lace

He does have a strange running style 	 It works really well for him but not for most running backs
What type of music 	 Pop music
Yea what have you been up to 	 Not too much I just watched Star Trek for the first time

Who do you think they look at 	 Neuvirth
Terry Bradshaw for Pittsburgh and Roger Staubach for Dallas 	 What was the point spread
They offer alot in terms of the story line though 	 I just think they are old characters and Star Wars needs to depart them
Comparing Lethal Weapon and Die Hard is very difficult but I would give Lethal Weapon a slight edge 	 I think I would go with the Die Hard series just because Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors

We do n't have either but I have subscribed to the package in the past We can still get local market games via antennae 	 Which do you like more about the game of football offense or defense

I heard the writer wrote the screenplay 	 Gillian Flynn right

Oh I think I get it 	 So what do you listen to
Well what about the emperor dose n't he have more power than darth vader 	 I do n't think so at all I think he is in a higher position to a degree but darth vader is the stronger power hands down

So is Justin Bieber Some really good artists come from Canada 	 Yeah His take care album became platinum too

Exactly 	 What are some other bands you like

Every song is crying about a girl drinking or his guitar 	 Or chicken fried
Uh yeah Look who you 're talking to Did you know for a time John Travolta was being considered to be Rambo 's sidekick 	 That would 've been a much different movie

But it sounds good 	 it sounds boring
The second movie of the Guardians of the Galaxy No I have n't 	 Ok great what do you think about seeing it

Interesting I actually do n't think I 've seen any of his other movies He is so famous though 	 Yeah he is I saw the Fast and Furious movie that he is in
Rascall flatts I wouldnt think of them like that 	 Think about it they are boys and they all sing together like a boy band
It 's not really family friendly though you think it was that big 	 million I believe
I thought Q as many people call him played trumpet 	 Quincey Jones plays trumpet drums you name it
Dan Marino was another great quarterback 	 He was down on the list too The greatest player listed was not a quarterback

I have n't seen it but I heard it 's alright 	 I have n't liked Adam Sandler movies in a while
Probably Who is going to give Denver trouble in the West 	 Probably KC
He met some flight attendants that introduced him to a big marijuana dealer 	 Oh wow sort of changed his life for the worst
Try Feel it Still Very good example of Psychedelic pop 	 Okay I am definitely intrigued
Because that would be a terrible thing to do after all they went through to be together 	 And if you remember they did n't get much time together in the last one
I know I think I probably would have just cried 	 I probably would have too
Me tooi want ro see it though 	 Yea ive always wondered what they did with paul walker
The Colts let him go because he 's old and had a neck injury 	 That 's unfortunate
Tom Landry 	 Oh yeah I 've heard things about him Mostly good
How far in advance does Disney-Pixar anounce their new movies 	 Well there 's a ton of movies that are supposed to be getting made but only so many are given rough release dates

Yes I had that on VHS growing up 	 Did n't you love it
He was perfect for the part 	 He made the part
He does seem like a nice guy 	 Approachable It translates into his music
Specifically north east I would assume 	 Yeah I wonder where the NFL was formed
I have n't heard that song 	 You should download some of his music before the show
it better be better than their old stuff 	 uh not so sure about that
So I have got into Disney movies recently 	 For the first time
Oh they 'll win 	 Yeah
You mean the silhouette of him slamming the ball down on apparel and stuff 	 It was pretty similar though
Yes I could n't believe the Rangers lost game 	 I know right They were within strike of winning the whole series and the Cardinals came back and won
I just won tickets for tim mcgraw this weekend 	 wow how many
I know right She 's one of the great talents of these days 	 Yeah I feel the same way
I know but not as long as the Rolling Stones 	 Do you like the Stones
Have you seen Moana 	 Oh I did it was great The way the ocean was its own character was fascinating
Did you turn it back on eventually or find out what happened afterwards 	 I was following on Twitter When the Pats looked like they were coming back I watched again
Yeah I first started hearing him just a few years ago 	 Me too but I think he was making music long before that
Do n't forget the younger sister who has been in about movies it seems 	 Oh you mean Abagail Breslin
Yes more in the romance department Skyfall really dipped into his childhood which was very interesting 	 I have to admit I cried when M died in his arms That was so sad
No some chiptune can sound like rave music which can even get scary aggressive 	 Wow that 's very cool I 'll give it a listen
My favorite is the Bengals What is yours 	 I like the Rams
Yea I played in high school it was fun 	 I played little league that was the only time
I think a lot of people prefer the oldies 	 I like music as far back as the 's
Dont all movies like that do it 	 Yeah but this took it to a new level
Sounds too confusing to me 	 Whatever is going to make the most amount of money for the large network is probably the way it works for the most part
It takes reconscruction surgery They use grafts from other locations 	 How long is the player out
No I think they just dont want to really win 	 I dont follow your logic
Me too some of the music stories make no sense when you hear the song 	 I will forever be a fan of music I would go nuts without it
Yeah I think Sammy Hagar did that one 	 They do n't make movie soundtracks like that anymore
Even the new Kendrick Lamar has some singing on it 	 He is a diverse artist though
Nice I will check those out 	 Do you like Rap music
no way I loved her music as well 	 yea her street style appearance and good beats just got my heart when I was in my teenager years
I think they had teams 	 I do n't knew that 's why I 'm asking you
I wonder if there will be others remaking his music 	 I do n't know but it will be hard to do
What song 	 Viva La Vida
I loved the elevator lobby scene It is probably my favorite even better than the one in The Shining 	 Did you expect the ending
He tells the girls he brings home Yeah i killed a jedi and took his saber 	 He 'd probably end up lopping off an arm at some point
What actor is the best in thrillers 	 I would go with Clint Eastwood myself
Do you know any of the artists that he has written songs for 	 I believe it was for Jason Aldeen and Garth Brooks
All I can say is this Wow Gal Gadot knocked it out of the park 	 That 's my dream girl right there
At least those in Oakland have another team right across the bay 	 Right That might be why it was tough to maintain a second team
Even the West has no competition though 	 What am I gon na watch The spurs lose by
Is it a thriller too or just romance 	 You 'll see when you watch it
Sounds like Kevin Durant is a beast 	 Yeah he scored points the other night
And now the Moody Blues will be touring this summer 	 Yes mostly the West Coast It 's the 50th anniversary of their first album Days of Future Passed They 'll be performing every track from that album and even playing with a symphony orchestra in some cities
Yes that is true 	 Well hopefully he can earn me some Fantasy points as a dark horse I am willing to bet on Peterson

Very funny We all anyway man I got ta go do some stuff I will catch you this saturday 	 Yeah for sure see you there man
Like Classic Rock 	 Yeah sure
I do n't think so who is in it 	 Matt Damon Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson
I liked The Bangles 	 Me too
I fanally watched The Last Boy Scout 	 Is that a new movie
Was the black guy Samuel L. Jackson wait that 's a dumb question 	 Yeah it is and of course he was Tarantino only uses top-billed actors in his movies and you did n't see anyone else mentioned except Jackson who was black
Next Saturday 	 Yeah let 's do it Want to grab some dinner first
Really How so 	 Hes been tweeting about his old albums releasing stuff and there have been rumors
Yeah but Eli manning is throwing to him 	 The addition of Brandon Marshall will take coverage away from him and open up the field
Oh yeah she loves all of them especially Frozen Snow White and The Little Mermaid 	 My little girl loves those to She can sing all the Frozen songs by heart
I did n't even realize that was independent 	 Oh yeah I think they may make a sequel
Especially the parts where he is just a bum who drinks and does n't care at all 	 Then he meets his soulmate and she tries to push him away but she ultimately turns his life around
I had no clue I did n't even know she still sang 	 Neither did I. I have n't heard anything from her in a while
rip pantera 	 they saved metal during the 90s

They are making a sequel to Top Gun 	 What Will it star Tom Cruise again
Do you know which album it is on 	 The White Album
That must be something to hear Who else 	 Well Jerry Lee Lewis the piano player
Trust me he 's a great actor and perfect for the part 	 I 'll have to take your word for it
Movie buff huh 	 Yeah I guess would have to choose drama
I love that movie I laughed the whole way through it 	 I know right My name is Inigo Montoya you killed my father Prepare to die
Belichick has never won anything without Brady either 	 I think we will just have to agree to disagree about this issue
Yeah and Peterson proved them all wrong immediately 	 That 's when he was getting a lot of praise and people were calling him a freak of nature
Really 	 Yes Help and a Hard Days Night and they were n't too bad
Well I feel like the songs they place of his on the radio are catchy but just not that great quality wise 	 Well you definitely have to listen to his other music because I would agree the songs on the radio are more overrated than they need to be
It is interesting 	 Is the album out yet
Yes they got a new singer 	 Are they as good
It 's no wonder he was a true movie star and starred in so many films 	 I liked It 's A Wonderful Life because it showed people having hardships So many times families in movies have perfect homes and lives and jobs but that 's not the way the real world is
What were some of their songs maybe I 'll recognize one 	 Rock n Roll All Night and Party Everyday and Beth
Yeah I do n't think they should have sent Ellsbury home 	 I think you have to send him there I think he has a better chance of scoring than Holliday getting another hit
Most of the great singers started that way though 	 I like a group of singers better sometimes Like the Andrew Sisters
I do n't know a lot about it Is it called Mercedes Dome or something like that 	 To tell you the truth I know it is Mercedes something But I 'm not sure what exactly
They do n't need to be a top running team to be a threat It just has to be a threat to the opposing defense somewhat 	 Yeah Any kind of running game would make their receivers even more of threat
It really is a great movie Trust me on this one 	 Oh I will When can we get together for movie night
Yes I think so and you 	 I am amazing
mee too I think he did a great job on that one 	 I will try the streaming radio
You saw it too What did you think 	 I liked it It was brutal but human and kind of darkly funny at times
I do n't remember what they looked like 	 The aliens from Close Encounters are just the stereotypical greys Long limbs large eyes no nose
Can not wait 	 My Titans are going to be really good
Me too I cant wait to beat you 	 Keep dreaming man Im the champ
Yea and then they showed a video montage of Paul Walker and Brian 	 It had me crying It was so sad
It 's true He can seem to get away with some funny stuff that would n't work for other rappers 	 Maybe it 's his slim shady persona that makes it work
Because he did n't want any trouble He had gone legit and was going to become a town 's sheriff 	 So he was on Jackson 's side Yeah it sounds like Jackson did n't really have any enemies
But think about it They are only a game and a half behind the yankees 	 True The Orioles have been playing pretty well this year
This new song might be a miss 	 Well I will look it up on youtube and let you know what I think
Yea hes like and has already hit around home runs 	 Wow he is huge could be the next barry bonds
If you were going to make a list of songs for an Evolution of Rock Music playlist what would you choose 	 Well first I 'd choose something by Elvis Presley
Great Do you have any links to some of your favorite songs 	 Sure I have a few in my YouTube favs I can get you
George Lucas 	 Who was the producer
I do too It was like an event 	 The movies really blew my mind because they were n't like anything out there
Yeah I see what you mean It 's like what does n't happen is just important as what does 	 Exactly And I feel like in those quieter scenes you get to absorb the landscape the wardrobe the props and everything that you may have envisioned while reading the book and it lends itself well to the overall feeling of the story
i would go if i had some extra money how much is it 	 i think it 's for a ticket
Did you ever watch Batman vs Superman 	 Yea it was terrible
I would n't go that far he 's extremely highly regarded as far as I can see 	 I guess it depends on your definition of highly regarded
I know I certainly did 	 But we should go see them live
Who did you see them live with 	 It was at the Van 's Warped tour so there was a lot of bands
I do not disagree with you there 	 What is your favorite song of his
There is a new Pirates of the Caribbean Movie coming out 	 Again There have been so many
Really Do you like it so far 	 I love it It has sirius xm radio which I have been listening to a lot lately
Have you ever heard of dubstep 	 No what is that
I do n't recall that one 	 Anyway kind of a tragic end
For example 	 -LCB- -RCB-
The Rat pack 	 The people from Saint Elmo 's Fire
Really You did n't like his song with Tove Lo Close 	 Not at all I found it way too slow and boring I do like Tove Lo
I think the scenery in those movies are just breath taking 	 Most of that was filmed in New Zealand
Their quarterback situation is still such an unknown 	 That is the truth They have Osweiler who himself is a big question mark
I had heard they played live at Coachella this year 	 I wish I could have went to it
The dark headed woman yes 	 That is one of his more dramatic pieces focuses more on adult and not teen stuff
Yeah I am glad they did not change the name 	 Yeah it would n't be the same
So who else you listen to 	 Have an hour
What did you think of the Casino Royale Move 	 Are you talking about the Peter Sellers spoof movie or the other one I 've seen both
I think I 've heard of that film does she play a waitress 	 I 'm not sure but I think she plays a secretary who witnesses a murder
I mostly like pop but lately I have been enjoying techno 	 I really like country music
Seriously 	 Yup all the voice-leading is correct with proper resolutions
Ok And that is good That is part of what makes watching football fun Every year is a new beginning 	 This was a good year for us
Yes action movies are awesome 	 I really like the explosions and gun battles in a movie
Yeah they were great songwriters 	 And vocalists
It was supposed to be after the All-Star break but now the Giants are talking August 	 Figure if they lose games they might 've won with him pitching there goes the playoffs
What is your opinion on Elvis Presley 	 I know a few of his songs and him of course but not all of it
Seemed to put it together though 	 I liked the shopping scene
Ha 	 Well I 'll be looking forward to that coming out
So it 's set in Portugal 	 I think so They 're in some sort of jungle or forest setting The main character seems to be with some Chinese girls
So I watched Split the other day 	 Oh yeah How did you like it
When 's her new album coming out 	 June th My wedding anniversary
well when u get some of that music shout me and let me hear some of that 	 Ok i think i might get it on itunes
What do you think of Terrell Owens 	 Terrell Owens was a great receiver but there were always drama issues
Who 's in it 	 Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels They 're both really good in it
Is the NFC East back 	 No too mediocre
That 's what you call club songs 	 I know it 's just nowadays music has no meaning
Yeah that final scene with that music piece was emotional 	 That It trailer mest me up I could n't sleep last night
That has to be Texas Chainsaw Massacre 	 Part or any of the sequels
Me too They have a lot of great songs and you know they are still great today 	 I know what you mean I think it is because each member of the band is super talented in his own right
Oh you have to watch it 	 Why is that
No it looks kind of dumb to me 	 It was a little dumb
Ive watched them a few times 	 Same
YES I WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU THEN 	 LOOKING FOWARD TO SEEING YOU AND YOUR FRIEND BYE
And do n't forget how the movie has held up for generations 	 Yes my daughter and I have seen them and she loves them
well ive been listening to some new music 	 oh yeah like what
What type of music to you like best 	 I find myself going for oldies a lot and pop
I like Empire Strikes Back 	 That 's a classic
There were so many great movies back then 	 And great actors and actresses
I think that that 's so nice It seems a lot of singers do n't write their own songs these days 	 I totally agree I actually read somewhere that Lady Gaga wrote Telephone for Britney Spears
You a melodic death metal fan 	 I 'm a fan of normal death metal What 's melodic death metal
I like to see movies in the theater about once a week and at home the rest of the time what about you 	 I used to like theaters but they are so expensive
I know they look like twins at times Almost interchangeable actors Thomas Jane will always be the actor from guilty pleasure movies for me 	 He was in Deep Blue Sea and the Punisher right
The newest one eighth in the installment 	 Of course that makes complete sense
Fair enough my favorite Oliver Stone film would probably have to be Platoon 	 That was a great film but I always preferred Full Metal Jacket to Platoon
Oh I like him He has a great voice 	 Yes he does He is so talented This album has a very retro feel to it
The Ducks won it in seven games 	 So who do the Ducks play now
Mine are Forbidden Love and Future Lovers on that album 	 That one also received an Echo award for best album
True Religion jeans are not worth it in my opinion 	 Why I love their clothes True Religion is a cult fave
Yep G Dragon is really good at that He sings and can rap 	 I know I love his music Crooked is probably one of my favorite songs
They had Kurt Warner as quarterback 	 Who was the running back

One of my favorite NFL videos that is n't game-related is seeing J. J. Watt passing the ball back and forth with young fans before a game 	 J. J. Watt seems like a pretty cool guy considering he 's huge and those pictures of him covered in blood are kind of terrifying
His life and what he has been through 	 Is he apart of a record label
Where is the label based 	 It was founded in the UK based in London
Probably Ariana Grande if i had to chose one 	 Oh man did you hear about what happened at her concert
It is cool you can look at it as a whole or in pieces 	 Part of the genius of the creation of it

Even though he killed his mother 	 The ending was a little twisted too
I do to it is like he does it with more feelings 	 I really like God gave me you
I really hope you are right The Cowboys offense is so good they just need a half decent quarterback to score 	 No doubt All Dak Prescott has to do is not be bad and they should be able to win
Who else do you like besides Sarah McLachlan 	 Katy Perry I like a lot
I did find that a little ironic 	 Granted it was better than Bat Man vs Super Man

Hard to believe The Pacifier is a Disney film 	 That does not surprise me one bit
Me too 	 I wish they still rapped like they used to

Where did the time go Pearl Jam is years old already 	 It seems like only yesterday that the grunge music movement took over

I quite did 	 it is intense and a little creepy
That wowld 've been cool 	 You know he 's giving into the dark side and his saber is reacting to his negative energy

Sure but I think Steven Tyler is so old now he couldnt handle it 	 I still remember hearing Crazy for the first time
Some of the best songwriting is also happening in that genre 	 Without a doubt
My other favorite part about The Empire Strikes back was the saber fight between Luke and Darth Vader That was awesome 	 It was n't bad The lightsaber combat is so hard to watch now that I 've seen the flashier choreography in the prequels
And is all alone in their universes 	 So I think that contributes to something

When did it come out april 21st 	 Oh okay i need to go get it
I 'm sure people are creating it but I would n't know how to find out 	 It 's almost like films are now the only outlet for that kind of music It 's a shame they keep using old music rather than create new pieces as there may be an undiscovered Mozart somewhere

Anything i may have seen 	 Probably he was in both Nikita TV shows and in the movie Mission to Mars
They are a good team 	 They do have some good players
Peter Quill yeah he 's played by Chris Pratt He does a great job in the role 	 Yeah the whole cast is so good
It sounds kind of like house music 	 Well house music can have a simplistic repetitive nature to it so in that regard it is similar The overall effect is not like night club music though
so where did you see it are they playing it on a theater 	 not really this one is a little old one so you probably need to get a dvd
Do you think world war Z could have been made better 	 I think the military and not being able to sustain life for those not infected was not correct

Not too much Do you 	 I have really started to get into it

Nah Batman Vs Superman 	 That 's techinically a superman movie

But what about his movies 	 They 're very well-directed and action-packed Hacksaw Ridge was awesome
Did you ever see the movie Grease 	 Oh yes I 've seen that Is she Sandy

Oh I love Bad Books Have you heard Manchester Orchestra 	 No I have n't I know it 's the same guy though
Yeah although some of the bands from the 90s are n't bad 	 True I used to listen to Slipknot all the time
Also the part where they had cars latched onto Dom 's car trying to take it apart yet it remained steady A bit unbelievable 	 I like how they worked Jason Statham into the story and he eventually became a good guy
I love that song too 	 You mean Let it Go
All their players are young and unknown 	 They are now
They 're ok but not really my speed 	 What do n't you like about them
So the whole time they 're stuck below while sharks are circling them I 'm guessing their battle is time for oxygen running out in the tanks as well as the dangers from the sharks 	 That 's exactly it Those moments are pretty good and suspenseful but I had to give a thumbs down at the end I was n't happy with it at all
And think about the set if they were able to actually shoot in China 	 The family 's home and the Emperor 's castle would look so cool

They had turnovers 	 Do you know how many rebounds Carolina had
Who could n't recognize Ramona Flowers Scott Pilgrim vs The World was basically her mainstream break out role 	 I know she was in Final Destination and the Thing as well as a small part in Quentin Tarantino 's Deathproof but I do n't think she was a household name at that time

I agree Being cop is boring 	 Not always but in this case I like him more as street racer
The number I 've seen is nearly million but that may be an overstatement 	 million How is that possible
Just okay It was n't bad by any means but I felt they left a lot of meat on the bone 	 Explain what you mean
When 's it supposed to come out 	 In the Fall I think They played one song from it at the show I attended
When did this album come out anyway 	 Sometime in

It happened in 	 What was the goal of the league
The Chicago Bears are an organizational mess that over traded to move up to second in the Draft to take Trubisky I am worried for him 	 I wish I could disagree with you more but with the loss of Alshon Jeffery in free agency I do n't see him having any offensive weapons

So what 's good about the movie 	 The action scenes were pretty good and they made Kong a good character

Me too Even though I was more of a Freddy Krueger fan for I felt those movies were a bit more fun 	 I can see that I think Friday The 13th was more fans of gore and just straight up slasher flicks
Same here I wish they could make another great film like Star Wars 	 Me too It is such a cool idea
It would be historic Any NFL fan would have to appreciate it 	 I ca n't wait for the season to start already

Well its like rhythm and blues and jazz put together with a disco sound and beat 	 Oh yeah that 's good music I like that I like Bobby Brown
Four 	 Wow when did they win their second one
It 's an above average rap album for sure but coming in the wake of two stone cold classics it was almost boring 	 OK now you 're just being unreasonable
I am hoping for the best As long as we can stay healthy I think we have a chance 	 Adding James Connor to add depth at running back was a good move during the draft

What performances stood out to you 	 I liked the bruno mars the tribute to the people that past and that was really about it

I wonder if they are going to do anything next year 	 I ca n't believe Dirk is still playing
Yeah we have n't caught up on all the Mission Impossible movies 	 Me either

That 's a good movie I 've watched it about three times 	 It never gets old I ca n't wait til the second one
I think he needs a superstar to play with for this to work out 	 He is not the type of guy that can lead a team to the promise land

Well you do n't honestly keep track of all that yourself DFS sites will do that for you 	 Well some of us have our own stat sheet to follow different players and choose the players to stack on our own using that data
I have the cross of changes album 	 It 's so great I love that album
He has less than wins too Not looking great I mean how can a guy that was so good seem so average in retrospect 	 He did get a ring though so he has that going for him

it 's mind boggling 	 It really is And it 's not easy because you 're tryign to discover musical form out of these rules
James McAvoy That is one of the reasons I want to see the film 	 Haha I get it he is a truly awesome actor Portrayed demented quite well
But anyway I do n't know we 'll see if the Cavaliers have a plan this year 	 I know they got Williams now That 's the only thing I see that could be a game changer for them

Possibly but he 's not somebody who can grind you down 	 Yeah a real weapon in the passing game though
Me too it 's like Nascar but with hovercars 	 I want one now
Easy question Owen Wilson 	 What movie of his is your favorite
Agreed Back to movies what did you think of Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 	 It was unexpected to have split and so painful to wait for the second part I would have rather sat for four hours than waited another year
Exactly that one Angelina Jolie was great in it 	 I remember the sequel too The Cradle of Life

So what genre do you think it is 	 It 's a crime thriller
it really is 	 they are too late
Like in the comics 	 Yeah
Yeah the defense won that title 	 Agreed
It has some weird lyrics 	 I agree they really do n't make any sense
i 'm pretty sure i 've heard most of them cause dad plays them everyday 	 he should give you beatles lessions then
Did you see the Celtics and the Wizards game 	 Yeah man
He 's really well known for those He 's got other facets too 	 Yeah I guess he 's pretty complicated
Such mindless crap and the same notes played over and over 	 Yet country music has the biggest following
He does have a great attitude 	 He is very active in the community
I have some more Scarface facts if you want to hear them 	 Yeah I 'd love to hear them

I always tie my highschool years to Jewel and Britney Spears 	 Both strong women but very different
Yeah and it did not help that she is constantly being punched in the face and assaulted during the movie 	 That sounds really hideous She is just abused constantly throughout the movie
Yeah she did They seem to be making lots of new movies off of shows or kids shows 	 They made a Max Steel movie recently too
I love the intresting looks that stars wear to the Met Gala 	 Yes This years Gala was full of designs by Kawakubo

His flow is ridiculous on that song 	 Yea have you seen the video for it
Oh yeah I 've seen the cover of them all crossing the street 	 It 's iconic I think a lot of those songs were written individually and not together

They might They have a really strong team 	 They do and Matt Ryan is coming off a great season

Hah spoilers much 	 It 's a Tarantino film You already know that everyone does and there is lots of blood
I did and found it bizarre 	 So its definitely a horror movie
I love the part in some of the Madea movies where she has to go to court I laughed until I cried at some of those scenes 	 Yes I can just imagine seeing someone like her come into a court room
He was fired A couple of seasons too late in my opinion 	 OK What about Todd Gurley

It holds up greatly 	 Explain how I 'm curious
I would have to say the NFC East Did you know that no team has finished first in the NFC East in consecutive years since the Eagles in 	 That 's really interesting I just think that the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants are far superior to the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Redskins
Hello 	 Do you know who Lady Gaga is
She gets arrested for false reporting 	 At the police station she meets a boy
You remember Avril Lavigne 	 You 're kidding me The Sk8er Boy chick

The score is very eerie 	 It definitely adds to the feeling of being unsettled by something
My favorite group is Rascal Flats I have always liked them 	 I like them as well which songs do you like the most
And plenty of music 	 And you never get dragged through a museum or a big old church either
How about that kid Arroyo Only years old 	 No kidding He has been a great addition
Yes he also played for the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Boston Bruins 	 I think the Boston Bruins are my favorite NHL team from the U.S.
Nothing much just thinking 	 Whats on your mind
Yeah the prequel episodes 	 Man what a guy
What was it called 	 Americathon It starred John Ritter and Harvey Korman
I like that they did n't really show his face It made it creepier 	 I think so too but I hated that we did n't really know who he was The ending was unsettled
Wow that is a tough one There is so many to consider 	 Yeah but I would have to say the top one would have to be George Jones
Yeah it 's set in New York too I love films set there 	 I do too New York 's a good backdrop for anything
I liked them all The third was great though I thought it was suspenseful at some parts too 	 It definitely was Especially when the toys were trying to sneak out of the daycare
It 's so hard to choose the right wedding dress 	 Yes it is A bride wants to look stylish but she knows her children will be looking at those pictures in twenty years
I think they are awesome I wish they had made more movies though 	 Really I was talking more about their music
I am at someones house 	 Yeah
It really was great was n't it 	 It was based on a real league too
Did you like it 	 Absolutely i love her she can do no wrong to me
Yes but I always knew he 'd make this kind of music I love it 	 Okay cool
yes The x-men need to join too 	 I do n't think so That would be too many characters
Yes they are an okay team 	 I agree
Oh really its that good 	 Yes its really great
Which songs do you like on that one 	 Poker Face and Love Game are two great songs on that one that are my favorites
Yeah and Pinocchio sure needed Jiminy Cricket to be his conscience 	 That movie had a good message for kids about lying and disobeying
The free agent moves and the draft seems like an upgrade from the past teams 	 Yeah some of the problems were clear
So what did you learn 	 Well I think a lot of it has to do with marketing categories how the industry sold music to consumers Which surprised me
What does she wear 	 Coldwater Creek styles mostly Nothing bare nothing revealing though Soft drapey clothes
I agree They need that to go along with good quarterback play 	 Yea well with the contract that they gave Carr they let him know that he is the leader
That 's a great tune 	 That it is
I will have to get you caught up 	 Yeah let me know what to listen to
Have you seen some of her rings They are to die for 	 They are gorgeous but of course beyond my budget
How do you feel about the newer characters in the other movies 	 I liked that they used The Rock
I saw One Direction a couple years ago 	 Well how were they
Yea that can be confusing 	 Pacific Rim is a way better movie if you like robots

no when did it come out 	 just a few months ago it was on abc
He was alright 	 I may wait until it comes out on cable
Yup I was in it 	 What did you do
Maybe but I thought Christina Ricci was very believable 	 What makes you hate it so much
British screaming rock music all sounds like the Arctic Monkeys 	 You 're right about that They made a genre
Me too I 'm not putting down Madonna or her career in music I 'm just saying that what Lady Gaga does is different 	 What 's your all time favorite Gaga song
Which sports do you like 	 Hockey and really not many others
Well that 's not really a true sleeping beauty movie 	 Of course it is Just a different perspective
I really liked those old ones so scary 	 Prometheus was scary too
Which one 	 The AT-AT walker
I did I thought it was intense 	 Yes it is very intense and certainly epic
I 've always been a fan of The Lion King 	 Yes that is a good one I think it was released after Aladdin
yeah me either sadly 	 Just something off about it
Well you 're gon na laugh at this but like You 're the Best by Joe Esposito 	 Why does that sound familiar
No I do n't think so 	 That was their big hit it reached number
it was alright 	 it was scary so i guess it did the job
Does he even do that anymore 	 I 'm sure his name goes on stuff and he shows up one day to say if a track sounds good
Who did they draft first 	 They used a number draft and picked up a player named Jamal Adams
I can see 	 I wish more music was like this
Great idea 	 Thanks
I do n't think I would want to go all the way to Vegas to see games though 	 It 's not that far away is it
I do 	 Wan na come to my show
Yes it is so emotionally powerful 	 Wow I like how music can move me like that
I saw that He does n't get comparable pay to other receivers of his caliber 	 Which is strange because like you sad he 's probably one of the best in the league
How did the world series begin anyway It 's so stupid Oh gee look We 're gon na play for the world Championship Oh look only the Americans are playing 	 just about everything you ask is way to overgeneralized You really ca n't pick one single game as the start of the world series
Yeah I 'm only kidding 	 Figured
I do n't know who is in it 	 Kurt Russell
Really How would describe their music 	 Well they have a long history going back to the '60s so their style has varied quite a bit over the decades as have the members of the band
Do they have a better selection of music 	 There are no ads played
I was watching the game from the right side I hope you enjoy it 	 Oh yes I did It was a keenly contested game There was excitement all through Was n't it
Easy once you get a hang of it your I 'm a remix it for you and send you a copy 	 So I definitely want to hear it send it to my email
Hi 	 Hi
Wow that 's already a pretty impressive cast 	 Colin Firth and Meryl Streep also have big roles
Did you know that he is not only Pop but he come us in soul and the blues 	 I really love his sound
They have to think of new ways to make the game interesting 	 Well that doesnt really affect the game all that much
Well you know how the original song was written in German right 	 Yeah
John Cusack and Ray Liotta 	 Is it an action movie
Yep And one of the collections I bought has about CDs I think So lots and lots of music 	 So do you listen to CDs in the car Or do you listen to the radio
Sure I will let you know when 	 There are a few others that I think are good as well
Not really actually 	 Seriously
What in the heck is that 	 Piano guitar starts with placing the guitar face up in your lap
He is an amazing artist 	 I agree He has concerts coming up
Inglourious Basterds I think it 's the height of both his dialogue and his characters 	 I 'm in the midst of watching all the Tarantino movies and so far Basterds is my favorite
did you not see them all 	 I think i just forgot I know I saw and not on the third installment
Oh I love vocoders The harmonies are quite sweet 	 Yeah pop stars Roger and Zapp crushed the vocoder scene in the eighties
What is your favorite character in Star Wars 	 I 'd have to say it was Luke
Yeah and he puts a chainsaw on it 	 Oh and speaking of possessed hands the scene where his hand goes crazy and starts smashing plats over his head is funny as well
Michael Irvin was one of the best 	 I think Nate Newton was the best
He deserves this success Usually music that popular is just silly and shallow 	 Do n't get me started on Miley Cyrus Malibu
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
Yeah Kimbrel struck out the side to end the game 	 Awesome too bad i missed that
Yeah I remember that song is good they play that song every Christmas on the radio 	 Do you like his songs Everything She Wants and Father Figure
What that mean 	 I ca n't sit still that long
With how he looks I wonder if he 's Darth Vaders son 	 I dont remember if they covered it
College has a ton of players who are there to play College baseball And their dream ends 	 There are still examples of college teams winning exhibition games against pro teams Granted those teams are frequently made up of minor league players
Oh now I know who she is 	 Yeah she was also in a movie with Bradley Cooper
Uh no you 're thinking of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs The one with Dwarfs in the title Sleeping Beauty has the witches 	 Oh yeah the three little witches The pink one blue one and green one
I somewhat agree 	 It seems like tight end usage comes down to implementation
Did you see the latest Fast and The Furious movie 	 I did I thought it was entertaining However I am not a big fan of the movies
Yes they did 	 Are they in the hall of fame
I did n't think so Why is that 	 The actual story itself was n't much different from most Disney stories
For sure but they never got the big one 	 That is true
minutes is a lot of material 	 Yea well they know each other and let me tell you it gets brutal sometimes
Well Padres got their new baseball field right smack in downtown San Diego 	 Beautiful field it is ranks as one of the tops in the league now
Do you want me to bring any of my CD 's 	 That would be good what all do you have
No we rented the DVD It was great 	 I loved the first one
Me too I 'm going with my sister 	 I wish Disney would make a Peter Pan live action
I know I thought this movie was going to be more action packed 	 Nothing was action oriented for the first hour or so
No I did not know she was so young 	 I like princess Leia she was a very tough lady in Star Wars
Ice Age The Meltdown 	 I think that 's the one I 'm thinking of I think they 've done like three or four Ice Age movies by now
Hey lets talk football I want to see what your thoughts are on the upcoming season 	 Yeah I ca n't wait to get back to pigskin football again
They actually make a huge chunk of the sales 	 Oh I didnt know that
Oh yeah the song is called Diamond and Pearls 	 Oh i saw that one she performed with Chris Blue
It is Emma Stone 	 I didnt know she could sing also
I do n't think that will impress a girl who 's into classical music 	 Well what do you think I should do
Well he 's different and unique 	 Yes but are n't a lot of singers
Who do you think is the best QB in NFL history 	 Oh thats a tough one
Did the man end up saving jazz 	 Im not telling you it would ruin the movie
indie pop is so much better than radio pop 	 i have to agree
Oh no Our home record has been awful this year We need to just keep playing on the road 	 Last I checked Paul Molitor was joking around they will just wear their gray uniforms at home to get in that mindset
Oh no that is definitely a classic 	 What is the Disney movie with the fish named Flounder
Remind me who that is 	 Allan Rickman
That would be awesome I 'll bring the refreshments 	 Better bring some extra you remember what happened the last time we played Dallas
Oh that 's weird What else does it do 	 Well it has David Bowie as Nikola Tesla so that 's pretty cool
A Hitchcock classic 	 Who was in it
I 'm glad she is alright 	 Me too
No What 's that about 	 It is an animated Disney film
My favorite was probably My Bloody Valentine 	 I loved that song too
What about them 	 We can be political feminists or be our own heroes with those tees while looking like we are on trend
I like the fullness of it and how it fluttered in the wind 	 It was refreshing to see her go in opposite direction of what she typical wears
He will be a legend someday 	 Exactly
I do not know how they do it 	 Well they have an amazing defense but eventually they have to get some play makers on offense
It is different than his other works obviously more dark 	 How did he write if if he was dying
On that subject I wonder how much Leia learned in the years between Jedi and the Force Awakens 	 Yes when Han died she clearly understood the force and knew how to use it I wonder if she carries a light saber
Yeah that was terrible 	 Sometimes reprises can be boring
Yes but I like them Anything else you do n't like 	 I do n't like the way she dresses she is very young but dresses like and old person
Is it in English 	 Of course
Right the way certain scenes are composited and stuff looks straight out of a graphic novel 	 Well I suppose if nothing else Batman v Superman might win the award for prettiest comic book movie
Do you think the Patriots will repeat 	 They have a strong chance too The rest of the division is bad which means an automatic trip to the playoffs
I think fans would be concerned about the quality of play from their team though 	 That is a concern like if you have a Tom Brady and then a bunch of backups who play
Yeah that was cool As a kid I always wanted one of those 	 Did the guy 's character make that or was it in the house when they bought it
I do n't care I like it 	 There has n't been a band as big since
I remember one time I watched him play at South High in Worcester Mass in a pickup game 	 He went back and forth with a player who was black He called himself Larry bird The other player called himself Magic Johnson
Do you think that fans arent supporting the NFL for some reason 	 Not necessariliy i just know that it costs a TON to go to the stadium to watch a game so you have to do something to make it worth the amount you have to pay
It was good but I like the first one the best 	 It was funny when they realized what time period they were in

Its probably my favorite 	 Mine too

Yes I also like the older songs like I Wan na Hold Your Hand 	 What about Twist and Shout Was n't that in Ferris Beuller
You ca n't beat the early songs She Loves You and She Was Just Seventeen 	 I remember their early days on TV What did your family think of their singing
They have a much harder schedule this year too 	 Much better defenses he will be facing
Do you like korn 	 I really havent listened to them too much
I also like Justin Timberlake I think he has good songs 	 Looks like your a pop fan
It was more complex than that Without giving too much away there 's a bit of mystery involved with finding out about the alien 	 Oh wait Was that the one where an alien pops out of someone 's stomach or something like that
She did the right thing Just a shame her relationship with Nate did n't work out 	 I agree they made a cute couple
Yeah it is fun 	 Do you think the Patriots are going to be on top again this season
Because Beast Mode is n't on the team anymore 	 That 's true but they both still have a lot of the same players
Ah How are they making themselves stand out 	 How are they making themselves stand out and still look professional
The Fate and the Furious it 's a must watch 	 Oh wow I will definitely check it out

What did you think of Rey in the Force Awakens 	 I thought she was great I ca n't wait to see her training with Luke
Do you like Britney Spears song Baby One More Time 	 Yes I like most of her songs
Too bad Bet that thing is worth a fortune now 	 You know it The marketing back then to go with movies is nothing like now There was something kind of innocent about that time period
Happens to me to 	 You know Jim Carrey should do some more movies like his old ones Liar Liar The Mask
After he suffers a heart attack and is forced into retirement he tries to better his life especially his fallen relationship with his daughter 	 The Wrestler sounds like very a inner and personal movie How does it go for him
Me too 	 Do you like Jealous Guy
Actually Satisfaction is my favorite 	 Yeah it 's a good one
I only know a few of their songs I think i was too young for most of it 	 I have a huge song library l can get a couple songs to you that I think you 'd like
Oh no worries Which of those is your favorite 	 It would be P.O.D. To be honest
No who is in it 	 Russell Crowe stars as the lead its a great thriller
Just look at Bladerunner 	 I hope they do n't ruin it like Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull
Yeah I guess so 	 I think the team to watch this year could be the Tennessee Titans surprisingly
Yeah no it was n't plagiarism or anything Was n't Survivor the first time Beyonce tried to rap 	 I think so Jay-Z influenced her
Yes I am actually listening to the new SZA album 	 I think I saw a poster on the street advertising the album
I remember that one 	 Now days I like rap god
I think R2D2 can hover though so maybe he could have just hovered over them 	 Nah he would have gotten so much sand in his gears

Fast yeah it was good 	 What was your favorite part
Did the Red Sox get any runs in the game 	 Yes Young scored after Ramirez hit a triple into center field

Did you catch game between the Celtics and Wizards 	 Yes the Celtics won the game
I 'm not sure I used to love the Buffalo Bills 	 It sounds like you do n't anymore What happened

Well nice talking to you 	 Same to you my friend
Yes That would be amazing 	 Great It will be such an awesome concert

I would love for Eminem and Tupac to have had a rap battle back in the day 	 Yea that would have been a classic

What is a song she made 	 Forever Your Girl
Cool then i 'll host the following and we can just go from there 	 Wan na go to the mall to buy more football gear and things
Dude I can not get over the movie Split I watched it like days ago and I still ca n't stop thinking about it 	 Split That 's the movie with Brad William Henke as the guy with different personalities correct
Plus he gets the girl in the end and that 's always nice 	 I thought it was cool how he went back to school through all the grades to have to prove himself and it shows what each grade and how kids mature
Then do n't make it so obvious that it 's electronically enhanced 	 Wow you are really caught up on this one
Yes i loved the movies 	 Me too

Just listen to it 	 I can honestly say this is a humorous attempt at music
Yeah there are different kinds even this course is just supposed to help with anxiety 	 It sounds like holistic hippy stuff though
How about Gaston 	 Oh he was dreamy and The guy who played LeFou was very entertaining
So how do you think they will do this year 	 I think they will win like games and win their division
Of course They are the main guys 	 Do you think John Lasseter will direct it
He is but I 'm not a huge fan Him on his own is not enough to keep bringing me back 	 He has enough fans to keep a major franchise going for over a decade though
Yeah but I ca n't watch it again 	 Why not
What 's your opinion on scary movies 	 They 're some of my favourite kinds of movies but I have to watch them in a certain setting
Those are great I 've seen them all a couple of times 	 Yeah pretty intense What 's your favorite type of movie

Maybe I 'll see Dumb and Dumber 	 Classic One of these days I 'll probably watch it again too
It is my favorite type of music 	 Interesting What kind of artists do you listen too
Oh i have to admit i had forgotten that Yes he stands right up on a table and sings the song with all his teammates laughing like crazy 	 a big part of that movie was when Sayers got seriously injured and Piccolo motivated him in his recovery from a leg injury
I like that one too 	 I 'll never get enough of these movies
I think plastic surgery is sad and you see it more and more with musical artists 	 They all lack self esteem It 's really heartbreaking
Maybe something starring Reese Witherspoon 	 I 'm not sure what other comedies she 's been in She was really good in Walk the Line
Were they good as well 	 I liked them The book that was written by someone else after the author died will have a movie version coming out next year
He has an incredible voice 	 I loved the opening song in les miserables1
No for the season 	 Oh but they play the Super Bowl in because it 's in February
Well I think Yoda is one of the coolest characters in all the Star Wars movies I 'd have to think about it 	 Well I really like how he lives in the middle of no where in a swamp
Who directs this one 	 James Mangold is the director for Logan
I would say that as long as it 's selling and they can come up with a story line Pirates of the Caribbean is huge at Disney World 	 Very true and Johnny Depp has always done such a good job acting If anyone could keep a movie going it would be him for sure I think I 'll go see the movie tomorrow night Thanks for the recommendation
It may be necessary to get rid of the GM and the manager Just to shake things up 	 Yeah it 's time This organization needs a makeover

What are the titles 	 There is She 's Got A Way With Words and Honey Bee
Okay 	 Call Me Maybe from Carly Rae Jepsen

Have you seen frozen 	 Yes
Well I rarely do but you wanted my favorite 	 What about Taylor Swift
I love it Season ticket holder 	 Season tickets
That 's so interesting 	 Also interesting that the two that really kicked off all this Bob Dylan and The Beatles were nowhere near Woodstock
I also think Michelle Rodriquez did well in this movie She matched well with Vin Diesel 	 That is so true They look like a match made in heaven They were so into each other

I was stunned and my dad was pretty upset 	 Is he a Rangers fan
Beauty and Beat and As Long as You Love Me are the best on it they are all good though 	 Who produced that one
And how about Terminator 	 I think hes doing them again as well

From the trailers and pictures i have seen the aliens look like they did in the old movies 	 As long as they stick to the suspence and not just gore this movie should be as scary
HOW WILL YOU LIKE TO BRING A FRIEND ALONG 	 I WILL LOVE THAT I WILL DO JUST THAT
Do you know Demi Lovato 	 I do She is a great singer
They have absolutely The new album is worth a listen though 	 Maybe I 'll check it out

i think they do n't even make the playoffs 	 i know right
What about the Celtics 	 They have no chance I like their coach though
His lines would be off on their own not following the guitar with root notes 	 That 's true if I think about it Lucy in the Sky seems comes to mind
I think the new sequel trilogy is off to a better start 	 I think so too I hope they continue to evoke the spirit of the original trilogy
Really it 's well known Good women have high voices and powerful men sing bass 	 That 's just silly A person 's vocal range has to do with his or her vocal chords I 'm sure not personality
What is your favorite comedy movie 	 Um it 's a toss up between Black Sheep and Tommy Boy
Because 	 Because why man got ta be specific
I like to see different teams in 	 I was kind of pulling for Brady in this Super Bowl though
I do n't know They should especially if they are supposed to be role models for kids 	 I 'd love to see cops on the field actually putting these players in handcuffs and tasering them
I have seen guys get guaranteed rookie contracts of more than ten million a year think that they are underpaid And they have n't even played a single down 	 Really is hard to believe
What are the actors in man of steel 	 Henry Cavill played as Clark Kent
Does he have a good singing voice 	 He barely sings but I would say decent
Who played that role 	 Scarlett Johansson
People like the movie 's effects so much 	 Yeah like the light sabers those were high tech graphics then
Is it scary at all 	 Not really It 's kind of a zombie movie spoof
They did not deserve the title 	 I am glad they lost the title
Hello there 	 Want to do something
I was thinking you 'd make a good Abigail Williams 	 Really
On the contrary I 'm completely satisfied with them The difference was you had less available to be satisfied with and you just had to be content with it 	 I think I understand that
They both sing a lot of good songs 	 Yes they definitely do
You also had some super corny solo artists like Madonna Boy George and such 	 Right I ca n't believe how popular that stuff became
I would have to agree with your choice 	 Excellent
So this sequel Glass comes out in I think we should go see it 	 As long as he does n't cast Marky Mark
Yes even more creepier 	 I do n't like clowns
I sure do back when movies were great 	 I was thinking about short circuit the other day
You know I think they actually are going to put it toegether this year 	 I agree
I think that Vivica A. Fox nailed it with that gold and blue Giorgio Armani dress 	 Yes and doesnt Blakely Lively just rock that feather duster looking green dress
She just acts weird and dresses up to get attention and sell albums 	 Well is n't that what every pop artist does
I did regardless of his criminal record he was still a hell of an athelete I still think he would have made a better running back 	 Yes I agree once he starts running no one could stop him
That was shocking I could not believe the Patriots somehow got Brandin Cooks AND kept Malcolm Butler 	 That offense is going to be scary as long as Tom Brady remains healthy
What was your favorite Disney movie as a child 	 The Fox and the Hound Have you seen it
True 	 And has two rings
What songs were you listening to 	 I am not sure One was about Georgia I think
It really gets me going you know pumps me up 	 It is some heavy stuff
Yeah I guess I have dated myself with that 	 Not too much older than me
Probably remixed or songs of the past 	 I 'm going to get it and check it out
When does the album come out then 	 I think it actually came out June Spotify is just catching up
Oh wow Crookers was incredible back in the day 	 I remember those old school raves that is kind of why I want to go to Hot Chip
Haha well I hate the Steelers so we can call it even 	 Maybe the Browns wo n't lose by to the Steelers this year pal
Oh yeah I 'll be missing you The one with Sting in it 	 Yeah and the music video with the candles everywhere
So why has he been in prison for so long if only got sentenced for five years 	 He beats the guards all the time and he pretty much destroyed a prison during a riot and cost england millions pound
But Cobain was there guitarist 	 And Dave Grohl was their drummer
I do n't know he has not lived up to the expectations of a franchise player 	 I know I am worried about it he has to show something
Next to Normal is probably my favorite It 's basically a rock musical 	 Sounds interesting
The comics are good 	 I think I will just stick to those
I may have to agree with you on that she has a really good voice 	 I genuinely think that she 's also a good person that cares about her fans
EASY Aayla Secura my love being distracted by a freakin bird and then shot about times in the back 	 Yeah that seemed overkill
Yes they are Very much so 	 So what should they do
Because his lyrics were always whack 	 I mean some stuff was ok
I would have to say the 70s overall for music 	 Oh what groups do you like
Is it good 	 Yeah it 's not bad for someone getting into the Beatles
I must admit I am not a fan of the Patriots 	 Even if you do n't like them you have to respect the team
I told you I hate that movie 	 Please just take me
Lemonade raw and slow would be unbelievable 	 Just imagine Six Inch Heels even smoother
Have you heard about Hans Zimmer 	 Is he the music and sound composer of Pirates of the Caribbean
Same here I was afraid that watching the video within the movie might put me in danger too 	 That movie freaked a lot of people out The sequel was n't all that great
Do you know how many songs Lennon and McCartney have written 	 Has to be 100s I know they produced studio albums
Nope had one that came close but the guy behind me was a bit quicker 	 Ahh too bad I remember one year I snagged a home run in left field with my bare hands It was back in the Kingdome days Seattle was playing against Minnesota and I was set up in left field for batting practice I ca n't remember who it the homer but I know it was someone on the Twins That was an epic day for me
exactly his solos were great his voice was great his songs were great 	 too bad we had to lose him
I would n't mind seeing that at all Especially if the Falcons could win 	 They deserve one you know after all this time
I do n't know enough about him to know one way or the other but I 'm a bit surprised they even drafted a quarterback 	 They 're just full of surprises after picking up Brock Osweiler from the Texans
Want to ride together then 	 Sure Can you pick me up a little early so we can get a seat
It was weird how they digitized her 	 Darth Vader really kicked people 's behinds too
You mean the paranormal man or the guy who owns the house 	 Oh sorry the paranormal man
What is your favorite thriller movie so far this year 	 I would have to say Get Out
Yes it was quite funny 	 I would expect that out of Borat

Yes and no 	 What do you mean
and that 's why he 's the best of all time 	 When we think of the best musicians people never think of rap
Do you know who played her 	 Natalie Portman
haha no But I agree the cat made quite a impression on me it can somehow walk in different realm 	 yea
Do you want to watch The Little Mermaid with me later tonight 	 Wow I havent thought about that movie in ages Yes lets watch
The Patriots have always used tight ends well 	 That might just be Brady doing his thing
You must like something 	 Taylor Swift writes some good songs and I like Sia a little
Interscope Records produced it for Lady Gaga 	 I think she records a lot for them
Fox and the Hound is probably my favorite 	 Which character in that movie was your favorite

Okay It was n't horrible 	 At least you gave me that
Yeah I really like him 	 He is good
Hi 	 Hey

Pretty impressive 	 They were on ed Sullivan seventeen times
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-

Have you gotten to see Despicable Me yet 	 I have n't is it any good
Yeah I think so 	 Who were the other guys in that group
Why because you thought the ending was predictable 	 Yes I wished the villian in that one had got away with killing all the people that he did
What about the Dolphins 	 Oh yes I forgot Miami
I 've been into two first Pop 	 Okay
You 're right 	 They made a sick burn about all the industrialized music lately Reminding people that at least they still play instruments
Probably not They played with a band called Mannequin Pussy at the show we went to 	 That 's an interesting name for a band
Definitely that 's one of their big strengths as musicans 	 It seemed a bit silly at times
There are so many out there A few of my personal recommendations include Psycho Dial M for Murder and The Man Who Knew Too Much 	 Sounds good Are there color versions of any of these films Black and white is quite dull on the eyes
Yeah I was not always a Packer fan but I have been since 	 Who did you like before that
I would have to say romantic comedies 	 Me too I love them because they tug at my heartstrings but are also funny and entertaining
Yeah she was a good actress in it 	 I will have to go ahead and see it
So you think it 's just growing pains and adjusting 	 To a degree yes and the injury complicates things All in all he 's still very green and will need time to mature
God I hope not I 'll be dead if that 's the case 	 Think of it this way The longer the drought the sweeter the victory just look at the Cubs

Alright a fan thanked her because she was given an extra peice of chicken at a fast food resturant 	 Was Beyonce there

I have not seen that show 	 Neither have I I hear he is in the process of making another movie as well
Hi there 	 what are you grilling smells great
I definitely agree So when will you watch Cars 	 I think I will surely book my ticket for this week
What songs would you suggest from his earlier career 	 His Plus -LRB- -RRB- album released in is a great start
Well they had to wrap everything up because it was a prequel but none of the characters are in any of the original movies 	 Sure but why not just have the characters ride off into the sunset instead of killing everybody
I used to love his corvette song and white lightning those were my favorites 	 Absolutely Those are two classics to say the least
Are you a big football fan 	 I used to watch when I was younger but not anymore
Me too everything my husband said he felt about the original Star Wars was sort of how I felt about The Force Awakens 	 Right It felt good to have an awesome character like Rey and I adored seeing that Princess Leia had become a general of all things
Yes Toccata and Fugue in D minor were also very well known 	 I do not know a lot about classical music but maybe I should learn
Yes he had a small part but it was so funny 	 I liked when Jessie Esenbergh accidentally kills him
he sounds kinda like the weeknd 	 i can see it
I cant get enough 	 Me either
was Edwards Air Force Base 	 Too funny man too funny
Please we have dominated the Saints for the past two years Who Dat They 're nobody 	 That 's what your hoping but the Saints will run over the Falcons like a Mack truck
YES I WILL LOVE THAT JUST LET ME NO 	 OK I WILL DO THAT I NO WE WILL ENJOY THAT
Me too I loved him as Lafayette and as Thomas Jefferson 	 He could honestly do a one man Hamilton and I would watch ever second
Doing good How are you 	 Not bad
It had a cuss word in it Witch only with a B So he made me sing Witch but I would always sing the bad word when he was n't around and he was always trying to catch me doing it 	 Was your dad really strict
Yeah I figured maybe after what six or seven installments they might be running out of ideas 	 True a trilogy is pretty much the maximum in my opinion
Yeah it 's a good venue I wish I dared 	 It 's not daring It 's a little bit of defiance
I actaully think they id an alright job of it 	 But the human aspect of Robocop is what really grounds it The question of his existance his memories whether Murphy is man or machine correct
What were the best parts 	 There is a spooky demon that takes form of an evil nun
Yes because it has moments of suspense 	 I thought maybe it was a buddy cop movie
I 'm pretty sure it was the greatest comic book movie of all time 	 Of all time That 's kind of bold
Yes Russell Crow is hilarious in it 	 I agree I loved his chemistry with the guy from the notebook
Do you think Leia was referring to her adoptive mother 	 Or maybe it 's possible because Leia is force sensitive like Anakin and Luke
I did n't say it was n't but the historical facts might need investigated 	 I love the part we Cube says Bye Felicia
Oh it 's pretty funny 	 I thought you said it was a zombie movie
Agreed she 's a great role model for children though 	 Yes what a great princess
I do n't think so what is it about 	 It 's an animated film that came out in the early 2000s
so back to the wizkid video any cameo appearance as i ca n't watch yet until i 'm out of work 	 nah no cameo from any notable artist just wizkid and some couple hot girls
That 's cool I used to like Katy Perry I kissed a girl was really catchy 	 Yeah I like her more now she 's a bit more theatrical kind of like lady gaga
They sure did it 's sung by the cast of the new movie so there 's a modern spin to it 	 I guess you 're right about Disney music I 'll have to give it a listen now
That 's right Wow good memory 	 John Cusack 's sister played his secretary in the film
You have never seen it 	 Nope
He is 	 Alright second favorite
he just wanted to spit venom 	 to just scream as loud and as vicious as he could
I wonder if any of the other avengers will be in it 	 I do n't think there will be I saw the cast list and its just Tony
No but Roger Federer wore a Gucci jacket that was interesting 	 A lot of ladies wore gloves this year maybe that 's a new trend
Do you like Zombie movies 	 Yes I like zombie movies but I do not see any new ones coming to the theater
They no longer have Peyton Manning so they may not be as great this year 	 True I ca n't wait until the September 17th game where the Falcons play against the Greenbay Packers
Yes I did 	 What were the teams that participated in this Superbowl
I do n't think she 's done a song with an actual message in her music 	 Exactly It 's always about her body her sexual escapades and her wealth Nothing of interest
I didnt know mary poppins was a disney movie 	 I didnt know that either whered you hear that
cool cool I am so happy for you man so which AMC did you go to 	 oh the one near the 6th street
Lady Gaga 's version of the vocals her powerful voice singing a Metal song in her style 	 Me too I thought she did a phenomenal job
I remember reading about him in a paper before 	 Was he syndicated outside Chicago
I did n't think that I would like it but I did 	 It 's got the sweet music sweet cinematography sweet story
Haha that is a great one 	 Yeah he is Anakin 's podracing nemesis and he is one of the most unique looking aliens in the whole series
Yes and trust me she 's hilarious 	 Well this movie sounds like a total must-see
Anti flag is pretty cool 	 I dont know better music i guess
Cars 	 I like it
What do you mean 	 Well they all have a warm theme to them so watching them makes me feel like a kid again
Yes it is fairly old now 	 Who is in it
Yeah a psycho I do not enjoy watching play 	 Yeah his game is too him-centric for me
Their jersey is blue and white 	 Sometimes it is read and white
I just did not like what I was hearing about the movie 	 Hearing from friends
No I have n't What is it about 	 Remember the Harry Potter movies J.K. Rowling created a whole new series for Harry Potter fans
Yea it was a good movie 	 I liked it
What team is your favorite baseball team 	 I have always been a huge fan of the St. Louis Cardinals
Well he does it to himself 	 Are you saying hes played poorly
For those of us that are fans he was seen sitting and talking to characters known as Watchers made famous in the comics as a race that just watch but do not interfere with others 	 How was the fox in the move
George Lucas was a genius to make as much off of that as he did 	 It 's his fault though that we get all these films trying to copy the Star Wars formula now
No but they did do a cover with the London voice singers or something 	 Yeah that 's it That 's a great song I loved it
I ca n't wait to see JJ return to the field He 's such an unstoppable pass rusher 	 You can feel the fear in quarterbacks when he 's lined across from them I hope he makes a good and healthy return too
I lived in a big neighborhood and all the kids played 	 Seriously
Ingram may or may not remain consistent Either way you do n't pass on a legend like AP 	 I would have thought he would have retired a Viking but I guess he wants to see more playing time and I am not sure he would have received that with the Vikings
Well that 's Florida for you 	 Living in Los Angeles do you love the Dodgers
Yeah but we need the right kind of data at those numbers And we do n't 	 Even NFL does n't give you enough data points That 's insane
Me neither but he never gets hurt and has the weapons around him 	 I know he had a great year but Shannahan is not his coordinator anymore
It sure was I used to listen to it over and over 	 Yeah so many good songs Keg in the closet
Yup won one lost one 	 Did you watch the ceremony
Was that when they had Joe Montana and Steve Young 	 Yeah and do n't forget Jerry Rice He 's the greatest receiver of all time
I did not know that at all More than cute face 	 Much more I say Have you heard his song sign of the times
Yeah the idealism and optimism 	 Exactly and we need a lot of that today if you ask me
What is it about those that you like 	 I like feeling like I 'm seeing a different time or era
Thats a good one i love that one too 	 Its one of my favorites
I 'm not sure I bet he does 	 Did you see his last movie
And the dog 	 I always close my eyes and look away at that scene I have scene the movie several times but I have never seen that part
Every time I eat stick pretzels it makes me think about The Great Mouse Detective 	 The disney film How come
Yeah it 's very old and just does n't bring in the money it needs to 	 Gotch ya That sucks that they have to move but I 'm sure it will be worth it
It 's not really country anymore it 's more like pop music 	 When do you think it changed
I 'm so excited about it They just announced Ron Howard will direct it 	 I 'm looking forward to seeing how Alden Ehrenreich will do as Han Emilia Clarke is also going to be in there along with Woody Harrelson and Donny Glover although their characters have n't been revealed yet
I wish they came out with more than one 	 Same
Same It 's hard to believe the series has progressed to their children being old enough to have their own adventures 	 Seriously where has the time gone
I like those type of plots Is there ghosts in the house 	 Sort of the previous family were all hung on a tree in the front yard but the daughter was not among the dead and she was never found again
Well I think they built their own freeway section to actually film it 	 Really That 's incredible
It is I have friends who have told me it is very good Are you familiar with the story 	 Not really Should I watch some of the older Marvel movies
I just rewatched Rogue One last night It 's still holding up on the small screen 	 Really I thought Rogue One was a bit boring and had pacing issues
Why 's that 	 It was the first one I heard by them and it 's what got me hooked It 's a real banger
Yeah of course He 's also a band member in Queens of the Stone Age 	 Ah yeah their song No One Knows rocks
And your favorite scene from the Lion King 	 I love the entire Hakuna Matata montage
Heard it in a Love Song was one of my favorite Marshall Tucker Songs 	 Oh mine too And Down on the corner by CCR
I think it was back in the early 's 	 So they were active in the late 's right
Let 's talk about Thursday Night Football Is it a good idea or a bad idea 	 The NFL on Thursday has been around for decades and some of the NFL 's most memorable games have been played on Thursdays
Me too I can not wait for the sequel 	 I 'll be counting down the days
And there have to be sex scenes in every movie 	 Nothing wholesome or even interesting
I know and then they even added in some pretty scary parts 	 For sure I was really scared for a while and then I even started to cry
I mean more than one city needs to allow it 	 Well its more of a state thing then the NFL allowing it
Oh definitely How could I not 	 I love the song Twist and Shout
I see what you 're saying So you do n't like it 	 I do Like I said I 'm torn
I just did n't understand what was happening 	 Makes sense I think they 're so cool
I never understood why Anakin got so upset 	 It was a bad part of the first prequels
Clearly that was his wife who decided that they needed to shine bright tonight 	 What a great show we are seeing tonignt at the Met Gala right
It is a team in a warm climate 	 Do they play in the American Football Conference or the National Football Conference
Me too I always wondered did some of those funny parts happen by accident Or were they really geniuses who thought of it 	 Probably a combination of both However the new movie did n't contain any of that kind of brilliance even if it was enjoyable
Do you have a favorite superhero movie 	 I love superman
Oh good choice That 's my second favorite 	 Psycho 's my second favorite Hitchcock film
And Wonder Woman 's just unapologetically good I really appreciated that 	 I think she and Steve Rogers would get along well
Well if they were still active As I Lay Dying might be in contention for best new thrash band 	 Are n't they a metalcore band
I 'm trying to make a mix from my favorite 's bands and I 'm on this Rob Thomas streak 	 Rob Thomas Do you mean Robbie Thomas
Of course Brandon I love that song 	 The melody is so bittersweet one of the best songs ever written
Any other facts worth sharing 	 Yes it premiered in New York city during the month of May
Oh yes that 's my second favorite It 's hilarious Kronk cracks me up 	 Yeah I like the squirrel scouts thing with Izma
they just wan na be the next blink 	 well they are huge fans of blink
Seth Rogan is so funny 	 Did you see The Neighbors I did and I liked that one even better than the first one
Whose playing 	 Eagles are on
What are some of your favorite horror movies 	 I have a lot I like horror movies Some of my favorites are The Exorcist The Shining and Do n't Breathe was pretty scary
I disagree Pearl Jam was way better 	 Were n't they more of a 90s band
I heard optimus is the bad guy 	 I heard that too I will be curious to see how that came to be
You ever listen to Nicki Minaj 	 I actually do n't listen to that whole genre of music
It was insanely tragic they died so close together but 	 Yeah no I feel you It was kinda poetic at the same time
Me too but really I liked him best in The Office 	 Oh dude for sure Show was n't the same when he left
I did n't like Ryan Gosling 's singing 	 A lot of people mentioned that I think he 's a great actor though
That is another great tune 	 I was fortunate enough to see them in concert once
What do you mean 	 I mean the special effects were very high end
Yes That one was different too Good antiwar messages 	 It was actually based on a book by a British author
That sounds like a trip 	 Definetely Carrey is amazing
Ha ha your funny 	 Do you remember that baseball bit
Hey 	 Hello bro
I watched a really disturbing movie the other night 	 What was it called
Hideo Nakata 	 Who is the female lead
Of course it is 	 Jerry Jones gets his way
Do you like it 	 It 's a pretty good movie
Obviously Who do you think did the worst cover of it 	 Hands down britney spears
Really You went there 	 But of course
I bet you love watching The Voice then 	 Oh very much
Sexy Eyes and Only Sixteen those were big hits 	 I loved Ray Sawyer 's gravely voice I thought he had the coolest voice
Thats pretty funny if you ask me 	 Yeah I wish I never got into it
Oh man I MISS MTV music videos They were the best 	 80s rock music videos were even better than the 90s Remember I Want My MTV
Jerry Garcia 	 Are they still playing
Of all time That 's kind of bold 	 It 's pretty hard to top the humor in it was pretty great and it had a great story
Yea Helen Hunt Cuba Gooding Jr. we 're all good in it 	 Yes even Greg kinnear was good
I shipped Nala and Simba so hard as a kid 	 Well Nala was surprisingly cute for an animated lion
Did you know I 've never listened to The Beatles 	 What Are you joking
I do n't think they were cleared Usually when someone receives a punishment it 's because they did something wrong 	 Good point I 'm not much of a Tom Brady fan myself
I ca n't get into the new stuff Metallica 's putting out fresh material but the newer bands just do n't do it for me 	 What about Highly Suspect do you like them
That was an exciting moment in the series 	 Who was your favorite
I do n't think it 's just because of rap I think it 's because he 's really good at what he does he 's a great musician 	 Has he won anything
That should be really cool 	 I think it 's going to be a great time do you want to get an Uber or should one of us drive
I remember when The Conjuring first came out and everyone said it was amazing 	 It was It was super scary
Is that the one with Anthony Hopkins 	 Yes it is
I think this song is about always searching for something more that even when you think you have found what you want there is still more 	 Ya that 's a great way to look at that song
I love Vacation with Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo My Sassy Girl was n't it a flop 	 You 're thinking of the American remake it was a flop Try the original it was a gigantic hit
I agree Batman v. Superman had so much potential 	 I think that a lot of the hype for the movie died with the one trailer
that song blew up so fast 	 it went to every pop radio station
I think I 'll actually go buy that right now 	 I was thinking about shopping for new music as well do you want to accompany me to the store
Is their music good 	 I really like it It 's spiritual and transcendent
Peter Pan too 	 Did n't they do Robin Hood
The Better Man Song I knew that 	 Well she did I like her song Style too
Bad romance 	 Any other songs
Not really it 's just not Portugal the Man 's usual style 	 That 's true especially compared to in the Mountain Clouds
What did you think of the crab 	 You mean Sebastian He was a cute character He had a great accent
Man you got internet 	 Yeah i got some internet
But I mean do you think that it is consistent with his character 	 Well you do n't obviously I mean he is Darth Vader
It seemed to be very synth motivated and overworked 	 What do you mean by overworked
Wimpy kid Oh you mean Diary Of A Wimpy Kid The Long Haul 	 Yes it looks like it will be a riot
No way There are other shows that deserve a movie before it anyway 	 Like what Name one
Yeah and I 'm a big Steelers fan 	 Again with the Steelers
I did but I never went and saw it 	 It was n't as good but it continued on from the Blair Witch movie with the character in the new movie being related to Heather
Oh yeah he was smooth 	 His music spoke to me
I love the Pointer Sisters they are great 	 Do you like the group called the Bangles
I know it 's funny Amazing that he 's Batman now 	 Not to mention the lunatic from American Psycho
Another great movie Do you think that they will ever make a sequal 	 A sequel is reportedly in the works I really enjoyed Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn 's last movie together The Internship
I saw that one it was called The Martian 	 Haha I should have remembered that He also did the one set in China right
I sure do Stuff I did n't really like at the time is enjoyable now because of the nostalgia 	 Who are some of the artists that you listen to now that you never would have before
People do n't understand that fashion advertisements use a lot of tricks camera angles photoshop lighting makeup all just to get the perfect shot 	 It 's unfair that now they photoshop almost every fashion model 's picture or celebrities pictures They take attractive people and impose impossible standards on them like tiny waists
They are so fun 	 I love the old disney movies
Signing your arm 	 All the hippie girls were having him sign their boobs and stuff Being little I chose my arm of course
and lars does all the talking too 	 he 's kinda the spokesperson in a way
Well I 'm sure he does hit movies more fame more money 	 No I mean he must really enjoy the character he turned up in April at Disneyland at the Pirates of the Caribbean ride dressed up as his character
Do you remember Disney 's Bedknobs and Broomsticks 	 Oh my gosh yes That was from some time ago
Ha do n't hate on him his song Overwhelming is amazing that 's a hit record 	 Alright I agree with that I think his producer Oogie Mane is amazing

Yeah even if it is n't totally relevant to the conversation they 're so quotable 	 That 's the thing comedies compared to other movies quotable
There were sequels 	 They are great movies
I thought that too 	 It is still a little disturbing being left to wander though They could be trapped in a snow globe
Like that song Lazy song where he does n't do anything that day boring and whiney 	 Fair enough what about Thousand Foot Krutch
They 're definitely very energetic They 're decent rappers 	 Koreans like rap
Mom I just saw The Beguiled It 's set in the South during the Civil War It 's Gothic and funny and all about sex really 	 You mean with Clint Eastwood Did you see it on TCM
Like Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times 	 Exactly The physical comedy was a part of it you knew the moviemaker was just playing with you but the story had a payoff too
I do n't work weekends or nights at all 	 Okay Good to know

What gives you that idea 	 The fake Mandarin was an actor someone used to push an agenda

Amazing game one of the most exciting second halves I 've seen in a Super Bowl 	 Amazing unless you are a Falcons fan then it was a nightmare
Resulting in less stampedes to get to their parked cars and a lot less manic 	 Precisely they 'll be a lot more activity surrounding who can make it to the Shuttle buses fast enough instead
but movies are always chill 	 I feel like i have seen everything their is in movies thoguh
Yeah Vader is pretty cool did you watch Rogue One The movie was pretty sweet 	 Yes My eyes lit up when Vader first came on the screen

Well Blake Shelton is one of the hottest country artists of today 	 Oh yeah I know who he is just never heard any of his music
I like Amine ugly god kyle and Pnb rock 	 What are some good songs by them

I am really excited about some new war action movies coming out soon 	 Which ones
Wow Lady Gaga is an amazing singer 	 Yea she is incredible
Those sequels seemed to get better with time 	 I think the scenery in those movies are just breath taking
No they travel around the country and put on exhibition shows at different stadiums The closest exhibition to us is in Albuquerque 	 An exhibition is n't a judged show is it
Cool i like some of those too 	 Do you play any instruments
I think Buzz and Woody go out to find Little Bo Peep 	 That sounds awesome I ca n't wait
I am not sure who is in it 	 It stars Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandon
Why is that 	 It sounds like more blues rock music
Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd are some of the main characters It came out back in 	 Wow I ca n't believe it 's been almost thirty years
yeah why is that does n't make any sense 	 well you 'll know once you finish watching the movie
That is true my friend but at least it is football 	 Yes and it is away from the house for a while
But they still left a bigger impact than Wu-Tang did 	 That 's true But Wu-Tang have been making consistently good music not just as a unit but as solo members
What is your favorite action movie 	 I love Die Hard
That was an excellent movie A lot of controversial themes in it too 	 Right it was really groundbreaking Feels claustrophobic too so you get a visceral reaction to it
The one that women can do things just as good as men 	 You sure that was the message
I like some of their stuff 	 What 's your favorite Beatles song
I know what 	 They 'll win every time
I guess It did get stuck in your head 	 His new album is more musical
True 	 And I 'm like him
Bob Griese and Billy Kilmer 	 Who scored first
Tell that to Drew Brees 	 I do n't exactly know what you 're reffering to but I can pretty much guarantee Easy Breesy would dive on a loose ball in the big game
Like Petey Pablo 	 Joe Budden had one hit but hes big still
Yeah I also like him in Ghost 	 Oh yeah that was good Whoopi Goldberg was so good in that
Really I guess so If you were into disco 	 Well I was n't but still like some of their songs

What artist 	 Nickelback
What do you want to watch tonight 	 Oh I 'm in the mood for monster on the loose
I hope the Seahawks can get him running right this year 	 If any team can it will be them
REALLY 	 YES NOT ONLY COULD HE SIGN BUT ALSO WROTE POEMS
But the do n't stay too long 	 Nope Sadly they usually get in fights with him and he fires them
Maybe I should I have the beeter car 	 That would be good
For example Which movies 	 I think Pinocchio is a classic
Is he Thor 's brother 	 Yes but he is a bad guy
I just hope too much time does n't pass by or else he wo n't be able to play 	 I totally agree with that
Yes I think she said in some interview that Diana Ross inspired her 	 That 's hard to imagine but yeah I guess she grew up in that time era
The small stadium might be a useful experiment for the NFL but I think the Chargers still have an identity crisis Some players are unhappy with the move from San Diego and what looms after the small stadium experience is playing second fiddle to the Rams What is their to really look forward to 	 Are the Cowboys for real
I did not get to see it yet but I have heard great things about it 	 There is tons of action and Marvel Comics movies are always the way to go
There are a bunch of them Toby Keith Garth Brooks 	 Country sucks
Yeah he will like anyone whose a Seahawk Fan 	 Great I actually got a Lynch Jersey I can wear to over there
Now I know that one 	 well of course Stevie Wonder
GREAT MOVIE WHAT ELSE ARE THEY PLAYING 	 NEXT WEEK THEY ARE DOING SWING MUSIC THERE WILL BE LOTS OF PEOPLE DANCING AT THAT CONCERT
It also really resonated with me And so many others 	 I could definitely also relate to that sort of loneliness they sang about
You must really love that band 	 Yeah I listened to them all the time when I was in college in the 90s and their music really helped me get through some crazy times
I honestly thought it was really inaccurate While Dylan 's music shares elements with hip hop lyricism subject matter sing-talking etc. he did n't invent it 	 Agreed Hip-hop has its origins much earlier than Dylan in African-American music
Yeah they have had enough hits to be rich for a long time 	 Do you think they are one hit wonders
I think the actress they wanted back out 	 I heard they are doing a Lion King one too
Like Shock Corrridor And that movie about the woman where at the beginning they pull off her wig and she 's bald 	 Oh right she was in soap operas for years Constance Fuller I think What is the name of that movie Ummm it 's a good one where she ends up marrying the town ne'er do well and becomes a nurse
So what do you think If you like it I have a whole playlist of her songs that we can listen to on my phone 	 You know what surprisingly I really like that song I love the lyrics and she has a beautiful voice
You mean alternative rock and the grunge movement Yeah I totally get that I did n't listen to a lot of radio I got music from friends and we passed it around 	 Ah yes the iconic mixed tape
What sort of artists do you consider classic 	 I really like Willie Nelson Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings to name a few
My favorite was Addree Jackson from USC although I will admit I 'm partial to USC Juju is so fast and explosive as a return man and a corner back 	 He is fun to watch He has the speed without a doubt However he does n't have the obvious size or strength I will admit there are not many athletes with his talent
Oh man I am so ashamed of you right now 	 I know I know
Good question With the success off Paul McCartney it is a good bet to think that they would have 	 Do you think the group would have remained intact
They were really great A lot of great songs 	 I agree Then Sisqo broke out on his own
I think Disney has added something to them 	 It seems like they will be going for a while
How so 	 Well Billy Jean sounds just like Man in The Mirror
I guess it is because it is predictable Smoke has a distinct path it will travel 	 Wow that makes so much sense You should go in to movies
That is probably true he played the crazy insane guy very well 	 Still I wonder who would do good in that part
I agree I will fall asleep during the showing 	 Yeah i really want to see the movie i dont want to sleep through it
That would be so awesome They 've added so many players 	 I know I 'm most excited about Brandin Cooks How about you
oh yeah 	 me too
What 's your favorite western movie ever 	 That 's almost too tough to choose
I think she is just eye candy 	 She killed that role
This is going to drive him to go to war against the humans 	 They say Caesar will wrestle with his darker instincts and begin his own mythic quest to avenge his kind
In the end kind triton gives her what she wanted all along 	 He gave it to her when he realizes that humans arent as bad as he had thought
I guess I 'm just really attached to the characters from Harry Potter I wish it had been more related 	 Yeah I hear that I wish J.K. Rowling would write more books
Well everyone gets old at some point 	 His music though spans so many generations
Inherited runners scored 	 Thats a good stat
That 's right He will be a team player that is always remembered 	 Yes I know you know he made it into the Hall of Fame back in
who is Bill Laswell 	 do you know the Herbie Hancock song Rockit
I heard they were so it should be really good 	 I hope so some of the other movies these guys did were not so great
Katie Holmes was Rachel Dawes Batman 's love interest 	 Did Katie Holmes reprise the role in The Dark Knight
He played a person with developmental disabilities so convincingly I was on a roller coaster ride with my emotions for his character 	 I know Me too I felt sorry for him most of the time but then I was mad at him when he stabbed Lucius
hey have you heard the new Drake album 	 Oh man Drizzy is the man more life man
Who sings on that song 	 Tove Lo is the vocalist
On Saturday i will see something funny 	 But this movie was not bad
He has a very intense look 	 Yeah He is scarier than Darth Sidious
They all have bad relationships with their parents 	 It is my favorite movie
you know I almost felt like falling in love with someone I do n't know when I listen to Love Story 	 really That song really has magic then
Yeah I have been listening to Pat Benatar 	 Oh cool I love the song Shine by her
True but look at Justin timberlake he is a success example 	 Also Lady Gaga she won an emmy
I did too I went out the next day and downloaded his songs 	 Besides that music today at shit
Incarnate Hey same here 	 What did you like most about it
Really What 's that like 	 It 's really dark but it 's more about what you do n't see than what you do see
I think they 're ok but I hate that they 'll never be able to cross over with other Marvel properties 	 Maybe the Fantastic Four
He definitely had a resurgence and Derek Carr certainly made him look good 	 The Raiders defense was so good last year I hope they were able to maintain and keep everyone
Did n't Heath Ledger play The Joker in The Dark Knight 	 Yes Heath Ledger played The Joker But Paul Bettany was one of the actors originally considered for the role
Yea they added Desean and that should help 	 Yea that guy is a playmaker but he has to stay healthy
Interesting I think I 've heard this song before what 's it called 	 It 's called Mr. Blue Sky
What are some interesting stories from the early days 	 In the championship was played indoors
Oh you 're just a bandwagon fan who does n't love the Patriots 	 Am I really a bandwagon though I 've loved them for over years
It definitely sounds unique I 'm surprised I never heard of it 	 Yeah so am I. There 's a sequel too
They sure are and some of my favorites 	 You really need to see this movie
She is like a pop/country/rock crossover 	 Yes that is kind of true Although she sticks closer to her country roots for the most part
Do you think it will travel to Thor 's planets 	 No his character isnt that important
OK HE IS ONE OF THE TOP SINGER I NO YOU WILL LOVE HIS SINGING 	 WHAT KIND OF SONGS DO HE SING
It makes sense that the more knowledgable one is the better they will do 	 Yeah if we 're not in the same leauge I will help you make some choices as to what players to draft if you 'd like
Did you It Comes At Night 	 No When did it come out
I hope to go someday 	 Oh you will
not winning is not ok 	 you want too much
Nope I 'm pretty sure they 're over for good 	 No I ca n't believe it
I did n't see that I tend to stay away from violent movies 	 Well what did you think about Sully
They 're both in there that 's right John Gallagher has been in so many movies of late and Kate Siegel appeared in a handful recently too 	 I remember John Gallagher from Short Term with Brie Larson Fantastic movie
Yes me too I might have to move a few thing around but i 'll be there 	 What did you think about that new goalie tonight
I ca n't wait 	 I ca n't wait till we get to the watches part
Whatever So you did like the second one then 	 Yes It was cute Your kids would like it
Man that 's got to stink because they are all so good 	 I agree but you know what It 's not just a stain on the patriots organization
That would have to be The Phantom Menace as it just failed to deliver an interesting story line 	 Yeah I agree and it was just ridiculous when they introduced Jar-Jar I mean who likes that character
You do n't think the Wizards have a deep bench 	 No I do n't The Celtics bench outscored the Wizards bench throughout their playoffs
Well I just think they are a great team 	 Yeah they 've won a lot I believe
Ca n't listen to snoop properly without 	 Agreed
I ca n't honestly say I 've ever seen Rambo 	 Me either but from what i know it was a fitting ending
I just think it would be cool 	 I mean i guess it would be cool
That was an awesome movie 	 How did Spielberg get his genius
They need a reason to go to the park 	 No one wants to see RA Dickey pitch anymore
Alright There 's Havok Power Trip Vektor and Revocation 	 I 've never heard of any of those
Whatever Guess we 'll find out 	 Hey if it bothers you we do n't have to talk about it
Well it is an old one but what about Billy Madison 	 With Adam Sandler right
Looks more like a Vietnam War film 	 Yeah it takes place in that era Great soundtrack too
Well I definitely like action movies so I definitely plan to go 	 You will need to let me know how you like this movie
But 	 But it didnt follow the books as much as I had hoped
I love the song Hot Thoughts That 's the title track right 	 Yeah it is They seem really rejuvenated since they took that long break after Transference
Right or 	 One man band was good
So how did the Royals score their runs 	 Brandon Moss hit a home run into the fountains in right field
This music sounds good Who is this 	 This is Toni Braxton
I know Who do you think they 'll get to replace him 	 I do n't know I 'm sure whoever it is will be a disappointment
I agree They had some bad seasons but they did n't seem to have a sustained span of being horrible 	 It feels like Rivera Jeter and Rodriguez just left And they are right back to being contenders
Well football is a pretty rough game 	 I do n't know what teams will do if the NFL adds more games to the season
Yeah that whole scandal thing 	 Yeah pretty dumb
Yeah but both bands are still good 	 What about that one band New Found Glory
Who else was nominated back then 	 Celine Dion Smashing Pumpkins No Doubt
aw thats a bummer 	 i know i would n't recommend it
No you are right about that 	 And Javier Bardem is in this one as Armando Salazar
We are hoping for a year like we had back in the day 	 When did the Lions have a great team
He 's one of the best 	 Was n't that a Steven Spielberg movie
I really liked the whole Unusual Suspects twist to it also 	 Yes i know there was a couple of Unusual Suspect kinda movies but Smokin Aces is one of the few that truly pull it off
What kind of game 	 You know exactly what I 'm talking about what game 's would I go to besides an NFL game
Agreed Why was it so long 	 I 'm just kind of getting sick of these two and a half hour movies Could have cut a whole to minutes from the thing
Well the music industry loves a good controversy and artists are always more popular after they die 	 So John Lennon would n't be as much of a legend if he were alive
Well it wo n't be enough to overtake the Patriots.They loaded up on defense too 	 They picked up LB Harris from the Jets and he was really good last year They also scooped up Stephon Gilmore from Buffalo
Well it hurts my ears to be honest 	 You may be in a minority though Many like him
Right Yeah And who 'd have thought Jack Black could be funny without wearing spandex 	 Yeah And I really liked that British chap too He was also quite funny in this movie
Yes another one I have n't seen is Rogue One 	 That one came out last year
Yeah that 'd be fun what 's out 	 There 's a few movies out they might like Beauty and the Beast The Boss Baby and Diary of a Wimpy Kid
Ya I bet it will be better if it has Goldie Hawn 	 True she is like a comedy legend I love so many of her other films
That 's what I thought 	 But I do n't think you quite got it yet I do think of you when I see Gerard Butler but it 's not because of the movie The
I 'd say SexyBack was the weakest song musically but every other song was literally amazing 	 Did n't Timbaland produce Justin 's works at that time
It robs one group of fans a home game every year Some people save up for these games and have less chances to see it 	 But it exposes the NFL to other countries
Oh that part Legolas was under a lot of pressure in that scene Aragorn was yelling at him an all 	 That 's the excuse my sister uses That and bad writing
Not much You 	 Same
Hard work is important and drive 	 Determination is a must in football
I want to go see Meters Down soon it came out recently 	 What is that movie about
Yes of course Why are you a Harry and Hermionie shipper 	 Well it seemed like they were insinuating some sort of love triangle in the last two movies
Well it was nice talking lets keep in touch on those tickets 	 i agree
Sounds interesting 	 It quite is
Mater Larry the cable guy did an amazing job bringing him to life 	 Fillmore Reminds me of a teacher I had in highschool
Yes they play it in a beer commercial 	 Really which one
Yeah and Skalleluia Too Though I prefer the first one 	 There were a lot of good ones on that
Was it a fairly recent movie 	 Yes it came out in
I love Tim McGraw and Keith Whitley 	 I know a lot about the both of them My mom met Keith Whitley a long time ago
I did not know that1 	 Indeed and in the uncut version he is sitting on a throne like alter dipping his bread in the blood of his enemies like its gravy
Pittsburgh 	 Who scored first
I know She made like a huge change in her life Extremely proud of her 	 Me too Her new song Malibu also has a summer tone to it
I could not imagine him doing it 	 It would be horrible
I know LA went from having no teams to having two 	 And then Vegas now has the Raiders
I tend to get really tense I ca n't relax 	 I am like that too But there are times I think it 's fun
Like stealing 	 It was extremely disrespectful
it was full of those vibes 	 80s is coming back now
Yes 	 When
Name another pop song you liked 	 I like Private Eyes It 's another pop song by Hall and Oates
I love that band and Yoshiki especially 	 He is a good drummer and his English is amazing
I love Rey 's character 	 She seems like such a hero so I get it
Probably a cat 	 Gross
Well there were some interesting concepts and Michael Fassbender is excellent 	 I see
Yep and they were trying to rock 	 Trying but not succeeding
Tim Mcgraw is my favorite 	 What is your favorite Tim McGraw song
Yeah the base defense has become the nickel You need three corners on the field all day and if you have injury problems pretty soon you 're going to have some bad players out there 	 I think this is precisely what happened to the Packers defense last year
Yup he broke his leg but he should be good now He 's a young one 	 From Hawaii right Who 'd have thought
Davy Jones came by to sign autographs and I had to go see him 	 Hahaha sweet Did you get an autograph
Pretty much 	 Playing some video games
So what is it about 	 Its about honor respect and loyalty
One of her movies is called Halloween that came out in 	 Oh yeah right Of course I 've seen that movie
Yeah but there is so much more to it than that Lots of rich characters the actress is amazing 	 Actress So like one person does all the characters
I know right 	 It 's a terrible way to treat Cooper/Dougie
You got paid for that I figured it would be for a credit 	 No no credits We performed pre-game post-game and during time-outs
Not really they worked with some younger groups like lyfe and black star 	 So the mentored alot of younger rappers
Tons Beauty The Beast was fantastic but your wife would kill you if you saw it without her um Wonder Woman Definitely Wonder Woman 	 Really But it 's a DC movie
Goff is used to playing with WR 's in a spread system He might not have four WR 's that belong on an NFL roster with the Rams offense let alone on the field at one time 	 That 's a fair concern though Goff did have a lot of control over playcalling in his final season
All you need is love and Strawberry Fields 	 Hard Days Night
Tool has been a band for years now The lead singer is Maynard James Keenan and he has two other bands also 	 Really What are they
Well did you know golddigger was originally written for a female to sing 	 No I did not Crazy Such a male perspective
So what other type of movies do you like 	 I love horror movies
I grew up on their animated films I saw all their live action movies in the 60s too but those are pretty corny now 	 I like the direction they went with their more action oriented live action like Pirates of the Caribbean
It was a modernized version of Don Quixote by Cervantes 	 Well that should n't be too hard to identify
Seriously you 're the only person I know who still has DVDs 	 Really
I love in Rogue One when they are getting the plans at the end 	 That is a really action packed scene
Yes I love her I 've seen her in concert several times Who are your other favorites in any genre 	 I like Paramore That 's my favorite group I also love Adele
I guess that 's one of the few properties that can say that Fans got mad but ultimately still went to theaters to see it 	 Good special effects can do that for you Just like at every Michael Bay movie ever made
So what 's your favorite song by him 	 I like one called Stable Song
It was a really good comedy 	 It was nominated for Ocars
I am feeling a little gassy you think it is because of the food we had 	 Its is possible that Burrito had a lot of beans in it
Is that what that guys name is Yeah he did a ton of those movies but I did n't see them all Only a few 	 Trading Places was pretty funny Back in the day Eddie Murphy was so funny
That movie was too ridiculous The premise alone was dumb 	 And The Rock was more believable He took down a team of soldiers
I wonder what new ones they will adapt 	 I do n't know I do hope there are more Pixar collaborations
That show is hilarious 	 It really is
Oh yeah I really liked that one too 	 I liked it more than Superman 's Dead and the others
you meanthe cat that smoke Hookar 	 yeah not a healthy cat was it
Well we knew all the hits in the eighties And there were so many of them 	 Yeah and we did n't quite know what we were getting into with 2000s Michael
Could go 	 That 's very possible
Yes I love that movie 	 Denzel Washington was superb in the movie
Hotel California was one of the first songs i learned to play on guitar 	 Oh yeah Is it hard
I loved ET He directed that did n't he 	 Yes That was the first movie I remember seeing at the theater
My kids may force me to take them down to cars3 	 My kids want me to take them to see despicable
Okay i will tell you 	 Go ahead
Well there are n't many outlaw country artists left I believe However there is a lot of overlap between artists who were outlaw or outside of the Nashville music scene and red dirt artists 	 What is the sound like
What type of music are you a fan of 	 I am interested in rock and metal
I never saw Prince but I saw Soundgarden several times 	 How was their concerts
Yeah but I really do n't think LA fans want one team much less two crowding up their city even further 	 True what 's the point of going to a game in Carson if it 's going to take you half a day sitting in traffic to get there and get home
I think that is why music is important 	 I really enjoyed a few films even more due to their music
whew as long as you dont say the giants 	 ya I agree even though they did really well last year
Yes It is called ANt-Man and the Wasp and it will be coming out in 	 I bet that will be a hit right from the very start
who were the stars 	 Mark Wahlberg Charlize Theron Edward Norton Jason Statham Donald Sutherland
I like the Green Bay Packers 	 Why do you like that team
I still remember N.W.A. they revolutionized rap 	 They did everything they did pushed rap into the mainstream and made it more accessible to that generation
has been good for music 	 yeah it has kendrick paramore joey badass
the commodores 	 oh I remember them
It was like two hours long 	 Oh wow I better not go see it too late at night
What does that have to do with it 	 I do n't know there 's something about an artist being from your same town that makes you like them more
I 'd like that Is it any good 	 I thought it was pretty funny and obviously I love the soundtrack
Yeah and they were n't really active that long 	 I know They were together not even ten years
He 's probably the most gifted defensive player of this generation 	 I find him to be overrated if we 're being honest
Uh a few here and there I like DMX 's X Gon na Give It To Ya 	 Oh yeah remember hearing that on Deadpool
What 's your favorite Harry Potter film 	 I really enjoy the Sorcerer 's Stone
Dude was fast He looked like a little midget running past all these slow moving giants Dude was a legend 	 I wonder if he ever tried to dunk and succeeded
Yeah that new movie was pretty good I 'm not sure how I feel about the Cursed Child 	 It sounded a little to far off base for me Like the description of Harry sounded completely out of character
Probably country and western 	 I like classic rock
Yes I saw both of those I loved Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window 	 He was amazing You can not beat It 's A Wonderful Life if you are a Jimmy Stewart fan
what are your chances 	 with the cardinals i dont know
Have you heard Lady Gaga 's new album 	 Yeah Joanne What do you think of it
I do n't know but I know it 's in August 	 Let me see if I will be able to find out the exact date hold on It starts up with the Hall of Fame game on August 3rd
And Gal Godot was in the Fast and Furious 	 Hmmm still not ringing any bells
I think that 's why her music was so good because she was n't a beauty queen 	 I do think it helped add some emotion to her songs
Did you ever see the Edge 	 Is that the one with Anthony Hopkins
Yeah I heard that like the first week it came out 	 Do you like it
So far 's Spider-Man is still the best 	 I love the part where he turns into Pac-man
That 's true what do you think about Pirates of Carribean 	 Oh right I almost thought Disney only makes animations
We need way more data points more than they keep 	 How many more pata points
Yeah I had n't thought about that Do you think you can come up with the money somehow 	 I 'm wishful thinking But realistically I do n't see how we can pull this off even if went alone
They seem to rally the team pretty well 	 Guys like Bell and Brown really do seem to get a jolt of them
Me too they are so good 	 I like rostabout
Yes I love Prince 's music My favorite songs have to be and Little Red Corvette 	 Those are two of my favorites too
What is going on tonight 	 Got some band practice
i usually dont but i gave it a try you should too 	 great i will watch it sometime then
What 	 The original was so much better
Really I thought you were more of a Pocohantas type a free spirit Like running through the woods barefoot and stuff 	 I remember watching Pocohontas in the theatres and collecting the figurines from Happy Meal toys
Too bad all his movies are more or less the same 	 He lacks imagination in plot development
What about you what type of movies do you like 	 Well my favorite type is terror I also like drama
It 's about a place where Gods and people meet 	 That sounds interesting
Yes they did 	 I cant wait til next year
he sucks 	 I agree
I think they are one of the best sounding bands although they do n't get to technical with virtuoso riffs and such The lead singer has a very powerful voice for metal 	 Are they an American group or foreign
What was your favorite Disney movie 	 probably mulan
What pattern 	 You cry when you watch a movie that has a male father figure die and go away
Have you seen The Aristocats 	 I did It 's my favorite cartoon
There are n't any of those that are good now a days 	 What is your favorite game show TV show
I agree but I do n't like the sound 	 Fair enough Which ones do you like
I liked that my tweens enjoyed the movie 	 You bet It 's hard to please them sometimes with movies
Yeah I hear you 	 Pietrangelo just looked off in my opinion
I really did like that plot twist 	 Very fun indeed
Do you like music 	 I love it
That is kind of how I feel No one wants to give them credit so they just vilify them and everyone buys into it 	 That 's too bad because they really are a great team And that 's what I think matters great teams competing against each other
We got a good look at Luna too she 's quite the character 	 Tell me about it she 's a little strange but adds depth to the show
I guess that will do 	 I really to eat somewhere else
I have been listening to Kanye 	 Which album
You know what I think 	 What 's that
Who was in it 	 I think it was Bob Dylan George Harrison Roy Orbison and Tom Petty
It is hard to top 	 Let 's go to a game together this year
I 'm looking to get into it but I do n't know where to start There are so many genres 	 Well you could always start with the big four of thrash They were my gateway into metal
Have you seen the new Eli roth film Clown 	 I have not is it very scary
For real he was not to be denied 	 He did really well in Miami
Does she get him 	 No he runs away she goes into a mental ward and the crimes are unsolved
Oh yes I think a lot of their songs would be 	 Except the slow ones right
Why is that 	 The atmosphere is so great It is really alive
Me too its probably not the same without paul walker 	 I know i cant believe hes gone
So many acts There was Lady Gaga Bishop Briggs Gucci Mane Grouplove HANS ZIMMER There was a lot of variety 	 Who was your favorite
Are there any other films 	 Yes There are tons of Star Wars films
No not that I recall 	 Who was in it
I do not Where 	 AC/DC is from Australia
I am a huge Batman fan and I think in terms of film he is at the very top 	 I can not disagree with that one bit Batman has had many movies made from animation to live action What is your favorite animated Batman movie
I havent hesrd of it 	 Its such a fun song
Oh that 's a new one is n't it 	 No the new one is a remake of the old one from the 's
They really should get a few prospects now anyway But I thought the back up QB was pretty good last season 	 Yeah I ca n't think of his name though
But it 's so fun 	 See I get bored
Sure cant wait 	 Do you know what teams have the most Superbowl wins
Batman Begins was one of the best comic movies 	 Yea it would be tough to be better than that
I had the album 	 So did I and would listen to it over and over again
Have you seen the new Pirates movie yet 	 Nope but have plans to see it this weekend
I get asked that a lot but never have a good answer Probably Juno 	 Oh cool that one is so funny
Interesting can i give it a listen 	 Sure
So many hits 	 I love his real old ones
Yeah Mike Birbiglia It was good but I like comedies with stand-up comedians in them in general 	 Oh like Half Baked
They were good but not as good as part 	 Did you like how it all ended
One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest and Jaws are two great examples 	 Did Star Wars came out in the 's
As much as I hate cages I have to think you 'd be safer there 	 True but you 're all the way on the bottom no one can see you to rescue you
I guess for teen girls or women in general it can be good but not me 	 Yeah guess you should n't knock it if you are n't the type or something like that
Jay Z In my honest opinion he 's the most overrated rapper in history 	 Really He 's seen as one of the best
He got in great shape to do it 	 He has cool gadgets
Ridley scott is pretty awesome in general Totally excited for the new aliens movie by him too 	 Agreed both ridley scott and the new alien movie are great
I also remember seeing Shania Twain She was in Greenville a while back but again I could n't go 	 I managed to score tickets to the SC State fair and was able to meet Jake Owen before he was popular It was back when he first produced Barefoot Bluejean night so its been a few years
I love the star wars series 	 I havent seen it
It was a power thing too They 'd sign up a leading composer to only create works for them and that 'd annoy the other kingdoms 	 I 'm sure I remember something about that when I studied Mozart at school
That was a great era in music 	 Yeah for girls who like pop music
He has good music 	 I went to a concert of his once loved it
what kind of movies do you like 	 I like foreign films
Yes i did but it is worth it 	 Do you think he is going to play any songs from Graduation
What is your favorite 	 I love Million Reasons It is such a beautiful song That one is my favorite
What was your favorite part 	 I thought it was funny when he was yelling at the llama
Oakland is going to be nice this year 	 Yeah they are Carr developing and a veteran back to help him out
It is so hard to repeat though 	 It is but if anyone can do it they can
One of the few bands i like i havent yet 	 Well next time they tour you should
I think so The one I hear the most is Just As I Am 	 What song are the Girl Scouts singing for the Fall Festival
Oh I ca n't even think of his name 	 Did n't he spend half the movie as a frog That 's probably why we ca n't remember him
so many we have not even brought up candle in the wind or can you feel the love tonight 	 That was in lion king right
Well they could have advertisements only at the end of innings not mid-inning 	 I ca n't see that happen The more revenue streams for broadcasts the better There not going to reduce their revenue
Well I did n't like the alternate ending very much I prefer the ending of the movie where the good guy wins in the end 	 Yeah me too I like a movie that gives you an ending not like those movies that keep you wondering
I think it was the super indie show in a coffee show in San Francisco a few years back What about you 	 Well I had gone to the Bluegrass Music Festival a few weeks ago
I think it is amazing how good the fight choreography and gun play is in those movies 	 I agree I think it has the best shoot outs out of any other movie
Sweet I can play about the same I like playing the Queen songs the most 	 Wow those songs are some of the most difficult ones
Definitely 	 I cant wait
Yea but at first it seems like everything is fine But then she gets attacked by aliens 	 Oh wow nice twist
You mean Elliot and Sheppard 	 Yes I do n't remember two rookies on a team having a bigger impact
Can you help me find a movie I ca n't seem to find Kill Bill 	 Oh yes m am It 's right over here in the Action section
It is tough for him to travel now though He only goes by bus I think 	 So does the band still tour
Can you imagine that in 3d That would be so scary 	 That would be too real for me
I have bought so much stuff from them i also got a floral shirt a pair of flip flops and a skirt 	 I go there all the time
Oh Does n't sound like there is much in there to make a movie 	 Well it 's just the beginning is n't it It gets hairier because as she reads the novel we get to see it unfolding onscreen
I agree it had a strong sense of love 	 Oh the Anne Hathaway love monologue was a little corny I thought
It also says he has been singing since a very young age 	 Thats cool
The old one or the one from the 90s 	 Oh God the old one That remake was terrible The old one is classic and is the only one in my opinion
Are they keeping with the original cast 	 Yes So far Tim Allen and Tom Hanks willbe taking their roles
Corella was a scary lady who would want to skin dogs 	 I know who comes up with that
I 've noticed musicians often do n't have the musical prejudices ordinary people do 	 That 's true they often join with musicians of other genres they just love making music
They went to school with him 	 Really though
Wow I wonder what it sounded like 	 I 've no idea but there 's one interesting thing It was written using a music scale
I did n't but I can imagine how that one turned out 	 Cubs baby What it is that you like about Cincinatti again
Yeah I did hear that 	 Sounds pretty neat
Good 	 So what other movies do you recommend
Yes and one he paid for a ticket to be on the side stage at the Firefly Music Festival 	 Holy Cow He must love Tom Petty
That 's true I think Nick Lachey is still doing something in entertainment too 	 I still listen to them both on Google Music from time to time
Absolutely those are two of the best No matter how many times I watch them they make me laugh 	 Well you ca n't beat the casts in both of them Gene Wilder Madeline Kahn Marty Feldman Teri Garr they 're all great
She used to give me nightmares 	 Same here That is so funny
Hey who is your favorite team 	 The Carolina Panthers
OMG that would be so funny she would die of embarassment But I do n't really like newer music 	 You just think that because you 're comfortable with the old stuff There is plenty of good stuff coming out
I think it might actually go into that evil 	 What about Pennywise
That 's the one I 've been told that a lot of metal fans do n't like it much 	 That 's understandable considering that the band went from thrash metal to more straightforward hard rock on the album
And of course Kari Fisher 's cameo 	 Her second-to-last for the franchise Very sad
To a degree yes I do Without rock there would be no metal 	 Then why say to a degree
What about the Cubs 	 I think they have a bit of a hangover from winning last year They have n't looked good
Pittsburg Steelers But the Raiders run a close second 	 Not any NFC East teams
I know he has really good stats 	 Yes pretty impressive
How so 	 I mean they were just WAAAY too long for starters especially part It was like what nearly three hours I think
Do you like horrir films 	 I love them one of my favorites is the 1st original nightmare on elm street
No I do n't believe so What songs did he sing 	 The Power of Gold Make Love Stay and Leader of the Band are some of his songs
Possibly who is in it 	 It has Jason Segel and Kristen Bell in it
Yeah or sometimes they base a movie on things that are going on but it 's a bad thing like Skynet in the Terminator movies 	 Exactly but in this case it 's a positive thing they are n't trying to scare people
Her biggest songs are probably Merry-Go-Round and Follow Your Arrow Have you heard them 	 Oh I think I have heard Merry-Go-Round Did it come out awhile ago
But like prior Star Wars movies the characters still felt a little flat 2-dimensional 	 Until the end of the movie I agree that the characters were a bit non-descriptive However I also liked that the male/female leads went from enemies to friends
That 's a beautiful yet sad song 	 True How about Anna Begins
The music was good in the movie too 	 Yea the 's music is played in so many movies even when it 's not a flashback
Yes I had the chills watching all those worm crawl on people 	 I saw a movie called Ants it was about these giant ants that were hurting people in a small town
Yeah those guys are not walking out of the bullpen any time soon 	 Nope They just built that new stadium so maybe that will give the fans something to be excited about
I am pretty sure it was written by McCartney I think I read somewhere that he wrote it in the late fifties when he was playing hooky from school 	 It was an awesome song It was released as a single with the song P.S. I Love You which I did n't like as much
Oh Well at least that 's original I 've never seen that as a movie before 	 Yeah it comes out next year
Where do you think the EDM 's going 	 We 'll have to wait and see
You need to listen to it it is so great 	 That sounds great to me
Never was and never will be They got a sound all to their own 	 That 's for sure But I doubt they will put anything else out now
Did you know that Jodie Foster 's character was closely based on Carl Sagan 	 Yes I remember reading his wife said it was like watching him The curiosity and pro-science aspect of that character was so wonderful to see
Send My Love is a fun song for example 	 I could be wrong but is n't that also about heartbreak
do you have a pictre you can show me on your phone 	 yes take a look
Oh really Why do n't you like today 's stuff 	 It just does n't appeal to me as much as the older stuff does
That is a great idea 	 I thought so I think it is the perfect song to sum up their life together
Oh you watch them with your kids 	 Yeah all the time It 's a great way to spend family time
I would not say that 	 But it is true
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
What songs of hers would you recommend 	 I would start with Love Story
Well the music in Boheme is beautiful and it 's dramatic and lovely but Cosi is funny 	 It 's in Italian how do you know
Her lyrics 	 I think they 're unique
I really love that song that was on the movie Trolls 	 Oh do you mean ca n't stop the feeling
My all time favorite Eminem album is Recovery 	 I actually think that might be mine too now that I think of it
Then you best clear your schedule because Captain America is glorious it 's set in a time actually i 'll just let you enjoy it 	 At least tell me something
Hey guy Only days til preseason 	 I know I ca n't wait man Pittsburgh is going to win it all this year
Why are so many people into Star Wars 	 I have no idea But I really like the special effects
I love the plots 	 Overall great movies
Absolutely Now back to my question who is YOUR favorite band 	 I guess I do owe you an answer now do n't I
Oh yeah I was wiping away tears the whole time Such a good movie 	 Maybe they 'll make a sequel
Not great I ca n't seem to get my fingers to do what I want them to do 	 Keep at it I know it 's tough
I really think those are good movie directors as well Loved Fincher since I saw the movie Seven 	 Ya Seven is one of my all time favorite films Brad pitt was at his peak too
What you mean like no story or message 	 Yeah exactly like that but add on the fact the melody is bad too
He was under stress at the time And he protected Harry to try and make it up to her 	 He made it up to the love of his life by treating her son like subhuman garbage for seven years
Are you guys going to any games this year 	 I really would like to go to the Steelers Browns first game
I mean someone who is currently playing in the league presently 	 I would probably say Aaron Rodgers of the the Packers
Sounds good 	 Yeah I 'm surprised it 's not more well known It 's way underrated in my opinion
Truely If the team has a bad coach they wont be winning any games 	 Who is their coach
Awesome I 'm going to see it this weekend Tell me how it was without spoilers 	 Okay so it stays true to the comics in many ways but makes a few necessary tweaks to work well with the other DC movies
I guess you are actually right but remember that some people will follow and some people will lead in terms of fashion There will always be someone to express their fashion which then other people will copy Fashion sells relaly well therefore celebrities try to stand out of the rest even when it means to be the topic of controversion 	 Once you have mentioned the controversion What do you think of women who cut off all their hair in order to be bald or who pierce their bodies in a multiple places
And Amendola keeps taking payouts in order to stay on the team Danny is still a clutch player.With proper use he could play two or three more years 	 Do you think they should 've jettisoned the big back
The played on the credits to The Wedding Singer 	 Oh yeah That was n't too bad
We could always look them up 	 Yes I thought you might know
I would say the original animated version but I did enjoy the live action as well 	 I thought Bill Murray was hysterial as Baloo
Yes it is Did n't he just have a new song out 	 Yes We Do n't Run
Me either 	 Text me later and we can work out any details
I totally forgot about that guy That guy was in just about every Justin Timberlake song during the 2000s 	 I did n't mind that at all The played a pivotal role in making FutureSex/LoveSounds which is my favorite pop album of the decade
When did they phase out the leather helmets 	 First they changed them from soft leather to hard leather
Yeah I also really enjoy watching it with friends and family and make an event out of it 	 Of course The social aspect of it is all part of the fun
This one is more stylized mom the violence is n't too gory or bloody 	 I just worry a bit about you getting exposed to that but it has been getting good reviews
Why 's that 	 His music is so alive so driving and great for action
Because they 're a cash cow Marvel DC Harry Potter Star Wars etc. 	 Yep and I can see them thinking they can do that with Blade Runner
Have you watched any movies lately 	 I have as a matter of fact I just watched Couples Retreat a few days ago
I really liked the way that she riled up the crowd with her stage presence 	 Yeah Lady Gaga has the ability to do that Are you a fan of her music in general
I mostly like comedies 	 I do too Have you seen Mean Girls It 's one of my favorites
It will be interesting to see how this year goes especially with a new ball park and location 	 I saw an article the other day in AJC that called the park a Home Run Hitter 's Paradise
You 're right The last song I heard by him was Shining but that was on DJ Khaled 's new album and it featured Beyonc√© 	 Oh I will listen to anything featuring Beyonc√©
Well when Tony Romo recognized it and basically stepped aside I think that was telling 	 Yeah Romo just could n't get passed all of his injuries
I agree but they got ta fight through it at this point 	 Some timely hitting would also do them so good
I like Carmello 	 Well good talking to you
Do the Spurs even stand a chance against this team 	 I do n't think so It will be very difficult for the Spurs to beat the Warriors without Kawhi
Do you like Neko Case 	 I have n't heard many of her songs but I like the few that I 've heard
If you look at the music video people say that the amount of dancers represent on how many people were killed during the tragedy 	 Oh I did not know that But I know at the beginning of the music video Maddie the dance smeared her face with paint that resemble LGBTQ flag
No idea they seem to be going more towards animal movies 	 Yah your kind of right
Yeah I grew up with it so thats why I like it Whats your favorite band 	 I love green day
Right Oh I was wrong The screen scrolled Number is REM 	 Word Where are they
I love both Also pretty in pink sixteen candles 	 All classics what about non hughes 8o 's films
I like the feel good quality to a good Christmas movie 	 Which movie is your favorite
Dumb and Dumber is just too repetitious and you do n't have to think 	 That 's what 's great about it
I think one of them is on Orange is the New Black 	 Yeah again this was the female cast
Nope have n't been to the movie theater in a while 	 Me either
I guess just because it wins a lot of awards does n't mean that everyone will like it 	 True True
Would you want to go to one of his concerts 	 Oh my gosh yes That would be so amazing to see him play and sing live
The border states 	 I heard good stuff about New York
I made one like that once 	 I ca n't believe you can make clothes
Maybe I do like that they get by without a Steinbrenner type running the show 	 How so What about him do you mean
He 's scary And the great thing is that he 's back 	 What do you mean
hahaha but rich gang killing it at the moment 	 yes they are young and trendy for the new skool but real hiphop/rap is dead everyother stuff called rap we hear these days are some noise
What did you think when Vader put Solo in the Carbonite 	 That was actual not originally part of the plot
That 's a pretty good one 	 Yeah has all the elements you need in a good movie Story line
Yeah thats good 	 Do you sing much
yep that means we owe them a double ass-kicking 	 i know that 's right
Yeah I ca n't believe it won Best Picture So many other good movies 	 What would you have picked
I love the song Sweet Dreams Are Made of This by Eurythmics 	 Me too Do you like any of their other songs
Well true I really like Darth Maul as a villian though 	 Oh definitely I just wish they had done more with his storyline It was so short
Well I like old school gospel and he was the best 	 Name some songs you like
My favorite Is Guardians of the Galaxy 	 That movie is funny
Who 's you favorite NFL player right now 	 I 'm always a fan of Sebastian Janokowsky Who 's your favorite player right now
What do you think of the script 	 The script I 've only listen to few songs by them
Did you like Mr. Chuck Berry at all 	 i do like Chuck Berry especially Johnny B Good
Right now yes definitely because Julio has proven himself as an elite NFL wide receiver The numbers he 's put up in Atlanta for the Falcons the past years have been phenomenal 	 You do n't think it 's due to having a talented and skilled quarterback like Matt Ryan
Do you prefer watching Netflix movies when at home 	 Yes I think they have a great selection of movies
What 's your favorite Aerosmith song 	 I like Big Inch record
That one is good 	 I also like Spectre
Who directed it 	 Martin Scorsese
I totally agree with you The second Avengers movie has too many action scenes 	 I heard about that the next Avengers movie will come out next year
What is your favorite part of the movie 	 I like the whole time they are at the water park
Yes I hear that too 	 Well I have to go to lunch now but thanks for your suggestions
What other songs do you like 	 It 's hard to narrow it down but check out Oh Darling and Helter Skelter two of their more heavy sounding songs
I kind of doubt it Maybe one day a team will take a chance on him as a backup 	 I think a team might grab him sooner than you think
The ending was kept similar though with Nancy 's mom getting pulled by Freddy 	 The original was still better even without today 's digital effects
The Yankees are surprisingly good so far 	 I know They finally have some young talent
Definitely I 've been keeping up with the Dallas Cowboys all summer 	 Me too I think Dak Prescott will be just as good if not better this year
I love that Disney is doing more of those types of remakes 	 Me too it brings a whole new side to the classic movies
Yikes guess maybe my Falcons pick is risky 	 They seem like they 'll be good next year though
Definitely and then Circus and Femme Fatale were her sixth and seventh albums I thought they were a flop 	 I did n't like them at all either To me her original hits were really what made her a success
It had action just more back story 	 I liked the story of Connor 's mom
Apparently no one we are very sad 	 So will you still root for them
And beautiful too 	 Exactly
I know I like the nostalgia of his old tunes 	 My favorite album is probably Darkness on the Edge of Town
I guess so 	 Why do n't you come over and we can watch it togheter
Oh Do you think they 'll send her off somehow 	 I 'm honestly not sure what to expect
I thought it was a little weird 	 When I come around was another great track
Kick off is at we should be there by noon So what leave here around 	 And miss out on the tailgate parties I say we leave at
Me too 	 Not as much as backstreet boys though
Did you hear the latest Katy Perry single 	 Is that Swish Swish Yeah it 's terrible
I could n't believe how close that was to the cartoon version 	 Yea it could n't have been closer
zevon wrote werewolves of london 	 I totally know that song
Me too What 's your favorite part 	 When one of the Hyena 's says Mufasa and the other hyena starts cracking up laughing
I love that one 	 They sound good in it too
Well we ca n't think about that now We have to think about the upcoming season And that first game against the Vikings Oh my God we have got to win that first game 	 I know And can you imagine the hype with AP returning to Minnesota Plus it 's Monday Night Football I ca n't wait
You 're saying a football helmet is not enough to protect the players 	 That 's exactly what I 'm saying
Why unfortunately It looked good 	 It was terrible I expected it to be as good as the Brendon Fraiser movies
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
That was OK I saw that 	 She was funny to have as a cameo but did n't do much
Do you have a favorite artist on the G.O.O.D. Music imprint 	 Aside from Kanye who is of course the best
I thought it was very good I saw it in 3D 	 How do you think it compared to the original star wars movie
Heard it the morning I woke up after she passed away It was like a soundtrack to that moment 	 Made you sad Those lyrics
The French horn 	 Yes But technically speaking it 's not actually French it 's just a mistranslation
Has he ever guided a team to the Superbowl 	 Yes he actually took the Philadelphia Eagles there several years ago
Did you watch the basketball game last night 	 Yeah it was great I am surprised they won
Oh i remember that one 	 It was good
Cool I feel like her films can be sort of hit or miss but I think I 'll give this film a try 	 It 's also interesting because apparently Colin Farrell is the only male actor in the film really
I like James Earl Jones 	 Me too he does an amazing job as Vader
That 's hard to tell and I think you can really only give credit to clearly exemplary coaches like Bill Belichick 	 Belichick will probably go down as the best coach in NFL history so it 's hard to make comparisons
and Johnny 's face 	 Jack Sparrow is such a great character
Remember TLC 	 Do I Of course I do I loved their music
sure I love 's music 	 what is your favorite
That is very innovative 	 I love how the songs blend into each other
I would choose rock music over romantic music You 	 I like romantic music a lot so I would choose it over rock
Yes even the girl who was the blacksmith 	 I wonder if she was ever in any other movies
Yes it 's one of my favorites as well It 's probably their second best movie 	 Again it 's another one of their movies that does n't have a happy ending or maybe even a satisfying ending
Definitely After Manning who is there on the roster who is truly reliable The talent is there in spots but can it be counted on 	 How about the Steelers
What do you mean 	 They basically abandon their education
I have this really old thriller movie on my mind lately and I ca n't remember what it 's called 	 Do you remember what it was about
That HAL computer 	 Right That was a unique picture of the future that the director had
I must have watched it at least fifty times 	 At least Cousin Eddie is the best
I give them credit for trying but I 'm not disagreeing 	 Between Wonder Woman and Justice League they are skating on thin ice
oh like bob dylan 	 Yes among many others I take it not your first choice of genre
Did they just remodel that 	 I 'm not sure
Either way I love it 	 Would have loved to seen lynyrd skynyrd all together
Do you like Kevin Heart 	 I like him but he is not my favorite I did like Central Intelligence with him
Yes I am starting to get a vague recollection of this movie 	 Anyway Jeff Bridges plays the alien that falls in love with an earthling
Absolutely since Kubiak coached an unsuccessful Houston Texans a couple of years before going to the Broncos 	 Can we really attribute their success to the coach or is it more the players
But where was Yoda in ET 	 Well remember when they went trick-or-treating on Halloween
It started out as a good story 	 What do you mean
i just go through his discography when im upset 	 he should be as known as the beatles
Yes Darth Vader is one of my favorite characters 	 So dark
Me too 	 I 'm so googling her right now
What kind of rap music do you like 	 I like hip hop like 's stuff
That sounds cool I 've just recently started getting into metal so I 'm on the lookout for more good stuff 	 You should definitely give Mastodon a try they have been called the masters of metal by reviewers
Well aside from people like Kendrick Lamar and J Cole I feel like people do n't appreciate lyrics in mainstream hip hop 	 I can see what you mean to a certain extent but I feel that you 're exaggerating a bit
It really does She spends most of the movie trying to narrow down the father search 	 Well she has to end up with Mr. Darcy I 'm sure
Oh no you 're not buying into that theory are you 	 Of course I am why would n't I
So they are transcending the genre 	 I think thats a bad word to use
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
I think Jordan is the most prolific basketball player that was able to do everything from defense to offense 	 True People can claim that people have done much more impressive things than him like Wilt Chamberlain 's Bill Russell 's rings and Kareem 's with the most points ever
Well what Nsync songs do you like 	 Oh Girlfriend and Bye Bye Bye easily
One that did not get much notoriety was Hoyt Wilhelm He did n't make the majors until his late 's from his war service and was best known as a n awesome relief pitcher 	 I think he hit a home run in his first big league at bat and had a screwball that was almost impossible to hit I do n't know how many saves he had but i think he played until he was almost
its a beautiful mellow tune 	 he was inspired by elliott smith too
Sounds great to me 	 Awesome deal
I have n't heard it enough to know if I like it or not 	 I love the words in the song They touch some situations I 'm going through
This is true as brain injuries seem to be the focus now 	 And rightfully so We have a long way to go
How did you feel when he was shot 	 I felt sad the music industry lost a great man that day
Who are they 	 I do n't know yet
I can do the same but not very well 	 It does take some getting used to
I can sing every Disney movie song by heart 	 I think that might be the point nostaligia
Is it just me or has it been a while since Taylor Swift released a new song 	 I had n't really thought about it She 's done a few singles with people but when is the last time she released an album
Yeah 	 I totally thought that the Rockets were going to sweep the Spurs
It blows my mind every time I watch him 	 You think he 'd practice in the offseason or something
It 's based on The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs 	 Yes that 's it What a creepy story
Yes definitely They were better than the new stuff 	 I 'm not so sure about that It probably just sounded better to us
You busy today 	 Not really
Is Danny Boyle directing it 	 I think so his films are normally quite good so I have high expectations
Okay mine would have to be The Weekenders 	 Oh my gosh I forgot about that show
He wrote a bunch of one direction songs too 	 What about songs I would actually like
Where does it take place 	 In a city I am not sure what one
I think I 'm going to watch a Studio Ghibli film 	 Is that the studio that did My Neighbor Totoro
Yeah they always have at least one animated one severl action movie and of course those horror movie as well 	 I personally want to watch the new Despicable Me movie
You mean Eli Manning He plays for the Giants 	 No the other one His brother
Just for a brief second 	 So maybe if they make another E.T movie Jar Jar could show up
Yes I love those movies He 's so good at playing different roles 	 Yes he is I think I might watch Captain America now
Well does it even matter 	 I do not know
I really like Lady Gaga 	 Yes She is very unique
Yeah had some good position players too 	 Thurman Thomas
Yes I think so The home of Motown 	 Aretha Franklin is from there too Makes sense since she sang a lot of Motown
Who would have thought by putting an ad in the paper they would bexome famous 	 I bet they never dreamed of that
Well hopefully she wont do any more music with him 	 Yeah there are so many better artist to collaborate with these days anyway
I am making you really think during this conversation 	 It would be between Enter Sandman and Fade to Black
Yeah he does He almost retired 	 I saw that Steelers have no chance if he is n't their QB
Frances Ha is definitely my favorite movie of hers She 's so witty and her improvisation is outstanding 	 I really enjoy that about her plus she always plays such a lovable character
The one where Han shot first 	 Oh you mean the original release before George Lucas Added all the extra computer graphics
And it aged him like hundreds of years 	 He looked really old after that
I 'm not sure 	 Have you seen it in person yet
It 's a movie called He 's Back 	 What 's the premise
That song is sung by Rachel Platten she an American singer and song writer 	 Did she win any awards for that song
Okay dollars for the team with the most wins your Steelers versus my Broncos 	 Deal you should just pay up now
What 's the worst thing about the music scene that you see 	 There 's no passion left next to the artist just do it for the money
I feel like they are as well 	 What are some of your favorite Disney movies I prefer Tangled and Big Hero as well as Wreck-It Ralph over Frozen
I really like that movie a lot but my favorite super hero movie is The Punisher 	 Oh man I love that movie too
You do What about deflating the footballs and cheating by looking at plays 	 Well I 'm not so sure all that happened
The entire team acts like a family I like watching the fast cars too 	 Yes the cars are beautiful
As she always is but I would n't want to defy her 	 No Sir I never got the purpose of the chimney sweep
I did n't know K-pop was that big 	 Just google any popular K-pop song The number of views will shock you
I really like Twenty One Pilots 	 Oh I do too
Have you heard Kelcy Mae 	 Her songwriting is good but she 's boring to watch
Yes Her remix to Jungle was better than Drake 's 	 I 'm glad you said it How was vol
That 's extremely high praise 	 Yeah it is coming from one of the best lyricists of all time
And I do n't want to be the guy who brings up his small hands but well looks like I 'm that guy 	 The best Air Raid quarterback is probably Johnny Manziel Who was pretty exciting to watch until his life careened into substance abuse problems and domestic violence allegations Totally different QB than Goff is though
Oh I see looks like you really know about football 	 Well I do like it a lot and plus I play a lot of Madden that helps
boosie what makes you say that 	 because the type of heart felt music he makes
Thats true but I think the Patriots game will be fun 	 OH YES The entire stadium will be filled with Patriots blue pretty funny to see that in New Jersey
Oh ok 	 What do you like
Great 	 Have you seen the blind side
No They had a young Grant Hill who was awesome 	 You mean the washed up guy with all those ankle problems on the Suns
I like Alejandro because of the music video Are there any Lady Gaga songs you do n't like 	 I 'm not very fond of The Edge of Glory It sounds kind of generic to me
Yay You remember what was playing when the machine is stalking him at his room 	 Yeah I can hear it as if it was playing right now
I know but it has such a feel for the Civil War period 	 I 've never actually seen it but I 've seen clips from it a lot It 's in color is n't it
It 's also a great movie for those who have a big imagination It 's really seen through a child 's eyes 	 Where does the movie take place
Rogue One was a really refreshing movie because of that 	 It was depressing though They all died in the end
Definitely the original had a few scary scenes but this was much more intense 	 One thing I did like with the darker Gaston character they were able to give LeFou a chance to change sides
It is Lots of beer 	 Oh I bet Anything worth mentioning
What 's your opinion on Miley Cyrus 	 I definitely like her new stuff but I 'm not so crazy about her older stuff
You mean points over his career he ranks 4th behind Jabbar Malone and believe it or not Bryant 	 How many games did Jordan play
That was the end of Tebow He floated around a bit but never caught on anywhere else almost like he was a joke or something 	 I guess my favorite player was a real rebel Jim McMahon of the Bears
My first is the Tampa Bay Buckeneers 	 Seriously I never hear that one
Who 	 Idris Elba
You did n't like it 	 I just could n't really focus I was on a plane and the kid behind me kept kicking my chair
Fair enough reasons The other newer females do n't really have any love interest do they 	 Well with rae she sort of does but not as clear if that will develop or not But not as overt
Let them play whatever they want so long as people are enjoying it 	 That seems like a nice philosophy
It was released in 	 It is a teen comedy
Yeah dude classic song Makes you want to go hit the town and drink a few beers 	 They 're a bunch of Irish dudes Thin Lizzy 's an Irish band
Why not 	 Well the old ones were great
I think everyone 's favorite is Britney Spears 	 I know she is one of my favorites
What songs are you referring to by Kenny Rogers 	 Lady The Gambler We 've Got Tonight and of course his version of I Will Always Love You
Well probably a peacoat 	 But would n't you get hot
Whichever just the scariest movie you 've ever seen 	 Well thats two different categories and both have scary movies in it
Who is your favorite harry potter character 	 Hermoine granger
Yes That and when they were turned into donkeys 	 What was up with that
Actually yes I do but I do n't know that there 's any NFC contender who could beat the Raiders either 	 The Raiders Did n't they fizzle out last year
I have seen him hit a couple as well 	 We should try to catch a game together sometime
I agree but some of his younger material was more relevant to that time period 	 Would you let your young daughter listen to him
So do I. It 's always interesting to get a different perspective on things 	 Do you know who the actors will be
Yeah start with the first one It will help you understand the series 	 I 'm turning it on right now
Really who else was in the band 	 There was a guy called Humpty They had a song called All Around the World
Me too It 's been a long time since I 've seen her in anything 	 I think the last big thing she starred in was Bessie
It just sounds like everything else that 's out there now 	 That 's not necessarily Phantogram 's fault
Well look at us now.Is it possible to be sick of winning 	 Well we are both old enough to remember Carl Garrett Mike Taliferio ad nauseum They were lucky to win games a year
Yes and Robin Williams was a great Genie 	 Even the parrot was good
They were I also thought the stunt work was pretty spectacular 	 I wonder how much of his stunt work Johnny Depp actually does
I think Houston is also in a good spot 	 They definitely are well coached and have a great defense
Well I may have to listen to them more sometime 	 They definitely had a hard time with their label when they got signed to the big time A lot of their songs featured subtle digs at their corporate handlers
Go for it 	 My first one is Beauty Behind the Madness
Come on He 's an amazing character 	 But he barely even speaks
He was alright I was a Nomar fan myself 	 Agree to disagree chief
Yeah So they would pick some kind of interesting piece of technology 	 Maybe Starscream would have turned into the first window hinge
So many freak accidents 	 Yeah everyone was getting decapitated
Baby Groot of course 	 Really That is your favorite aspect of the movie
Yes but it was more than that 	 What do you mean
I do n't know man it works for me 	 What about some of the metal you were talking about
No 	 Who directed Star Wars
I think it 's because Nike offered more money to sponsor the NFL 	 Oh that 's right
Oh really so what do you listen to then 	 I only stick to the classics Nowadays everybody is sellin out
Another good one was The Green Mile 	 Definitely Tom Hanks played a great part
That was an amazing movie I loved the historical view of it 	 Who were the actors in it again
It has really been a long time since I 've heard a good rap album 	 Really There 's been tons of good rap albums
They made him feel better after losing his dad 	 They did a good job at representing what the animals would really be like The lions were at the top of the food chain
They have full length albums released over the last years 	 That 's actually really impressive
It worked real well with them thats for sure 	 Yeah I loved the movie and still watch it
What is it 	 It is Tangled the one about Rapunzel
Actually the last Star Wars movie was Rogue One It was n't part of the main series but it was great 	 I must have missed that one It was really that good
Look they have like a zillion new draft picks high one 	 They do n't have a quarterback still
That is pretty young 	 Yeah he was the butt of a lot of jokes in the media
Really Why 	 Sadness ruined it for me She was always depressed and ruining things
I loved the part where he always said Do you know how I got these scars 	 I know and it was always a different story
Not really but I love the Freddie movies 	 What do you like so much about them
It 's been used in dozens of commercials movies video games sporting events It 's like Pachelbel 's Canon in the old days 	 Oh no Do n't remind me of Pachelbel 's Canon
Anyways do you have Spotify and listen to any music 	 Yeah I like listening to Throwback Thursday That 's always fun
I know what you mean George Carlin was naturally great as you would expect him to be but all the actors with the smaller roles played their characters perfectly 	 It 's no wonder this movie was such a success I 'm not someone who just goes to movies all the time I go when there 's something I really want to see and I went to the theatre to see this when it came out
But they probably should 	 But the disparity is so large it should be a little closer together
Both good options But what about Mulan 	 Oh I forgot about Mulan I did n't own it growing up
Huh I ca n't even really picture him 	 It 's about a teacher at a boarding school who bends the rules to encourage a student who betrays him
No way the new movies are just as canonical as the older stuff 	 Are you saying Jar Jar Binks is canon
Yea it was laughable that the Falcons actually lost 	 Yea they played very cocky after getting a big lead early
Everyone knows that song All the Millenials for sure 	 Haha so true I also liked Quit Playing Games It was so upbeat
The Stones have been around forever 	 The Stones are still on tour
One especially is Beauty It 's a beautiful song but he dedicated it to me 	 Oh okay I remember that one
I see I did n't think they 's make storyline so ambigious 	 It 's not it adds to the mystery The whole movie is really well thought out
Why would you say that 	 The main reason is that they will take a child that they think is strong with the force and make them become a jedi
Do you ever listen to rock at all 	 I love listening to Joan Jett
Not really I do not think they are very talented 	 But they have so many hits
Gandolf 	 No silly Boromir
so is that a series or just a solo movie 	 it is a series I am surprised that you did n't know that
Me too 	 I really liked Manu Ginobili 's block on James Harden
Kite Man makes an appearance Did you see him 	 Kite Man Made my day
Yeah when you look at how far they progressed since about to or 	 Totally The leap from Love Me Do to the White Album is incredible
That 's true but it 's just sports Cities get alone fine without them 	 That 's probably true Hundreds of cities do n't have sports and they 're fine
And there 's a lot of them in that movie 	 That 's true but after a while you do n't notice
It really does 	 So does the new pirates of the Caribbean movie
I saw that too 	 Did you like it
Okay here goes Elvis Presely The Doors Eddie Cochran Def Leppard and Frank Sinatra 	 That 's a pretty cool list Elvis would make my list too
It 's rare for a team that 's so strong on paper to win the Super Bowl so we 'll see 	 They added so many good pieces to an already great lineup
I liked it What did you think 	 I liked it too but it was n't my favorite
Me too I 'm actually looking for suggestions 	 Now that you mention it I take a Zumba class and really like the music there
And then there was that one scene where Luke encounters Darth Vader 	 Oh yeah and he chops off his head
THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN FEATURED ON MOVIE SOUNDTRACKS 	 WHAT MOVIES
What do you mean suck 	 The old stuff is the only good music
Yes that was really sad His music was amazing though 	 His albums span how many decades
No he 's the greatest QB who had to resort to cheating 	 So you do n't think he would 've won the same without cheating
What are those music techniques 	 One is singing They have this really ususual way of singing It 's very high pitched
You mean that it was revisionist in the sense of how Westerns started to change 	 Yes I think so because certain tropes get played around with
Have you heard of Twenty One Pilots 	 Just this past year I enjoy them
Do you think Kershaw is gon na win the Cy Young again 	 I would think so but you can never count out Scherzer
He did that song Holy Diver 	 I 've heard that before
What type of music do you enjoy the most 	 Oh I listen to a variety but my favorite is old gospel hymns
Have you been to any games 	 A few
I think that was just the tip of the ice berg 	 Haha you 're right When she came out with What a Girl Wants I was blown away
Yup and there are some Migs in there too 	 Yes I ll have to see it
You will really appreciate this movie then 	 Are there good animal scenes
I clearly need to go see it 	 There was a scene where Wonder Woman sneaked a sword into a party by wearing it in the back of her dress and now there 's tutorials for doing that all over the internet
You 're an odd person 	 thanks
He revolutionized opera and the music of his era 	 Really
I may have to watch it 	 It 's so good Peewee Herman has a small cameo in it
So one team became two teams 	 Yes but it did n't happen all at once
It has a lot of memories for me because I met my husband at that time 	 Oh how cool
Right the changing perspective 	 In the end they are both reprehensible characters in my opinion
It 's going well How are you 	 I 'm fine what have you been up to recently
Well my favorite of the three is Lost in Translation 	 Who 's in that again Scarlett Johansson
Tell me about it she 's a little strange but adds depth to the show 	 Yeah not everyone is big family somewhat normal Rob or perfect little Harmine
Are there any other really good songs I should check out from him 	 I personally like Comin Home a lot
Yeah and that cost money at times 	 I agree with most of what you are saying
On the whole I really liked it It spoke to the dawn of their league coming together 	 Right Ben Affleck was a good Batman
Winston is a good quarterback He will continue to develop 	 I ca n't wait to draft Mike Evans in fantasy this year That guy always puts up points
I dont think ive heard that one either 	 Oh well you should look that one up too
They just keep making sequels to older ones 	 Like a 16th Friday the 13th
I have some of their music on my computer to listen to at home 	 What other Hip Hop music do you like
There are n't Many Modern as in how long ago 	 Let 's say last years
I agree They need huge games from Aldridge and Gasol 	 Yes That margin for error is super thin I do n't think those big guys can even have one game where they play poorly
YES ABOUT A TWO MONTH A GO I ENJOY THEM SO MUCH 	 DO YOU NO ONE OF THERE SONG THAT YOU REMEMBER HEARING
It 's called Your Favorite Weapon 	 What 's do they sound like
That 's a very stark contrast to their previous sound with the alternative-goth-esque sound they had 	 Yeah and it 's really refreshing David Byrne would probably think it 's derivative of Talking Heads but I do n't care It 's great
It 's fun to watch 	 Oh Who 's your favorite team
It 's crazy that Brandon and Bruce Lee both died in their prime 	 Yeah but that should n't have overshadowed their talents
Can you listen to your own music to block it out 	 That 's what I 've been doing lately I usually listen to hip hop when I play games
Nice You 're right that is pretty diverse 	 He is definitely the most up and coming hip hop artist within that last few years He talks a real game and keeps it honest
Yeah I agree There 's teams I think but only a few have a legitimate chance to win it all 	 Yeah and it 's hard to get into NBA basketball if your team is n't one of those teams that has a chance to win it all
what do you wan na see in new star wars 	 more darth maul to be honest
Okay that checks out 	 So anything else you need to know my liege
Yeah it 's my favorite by them 	 Have you heard You got ta not
How long do you think Mike Mcarthey will be coaching 	 I do n't know seems like he has been coaching the Pack forever
You must know Rangers a lot Do you have many Rangers souvenirs 	 Yeah I have collected different types of souvenirs like T-shirt hat footwear etc.
Not exactly 	 That is too bad
It 's a French sci-fi film directed by Jean-Luc Godard 	 What 's it about
Hello 	 Whatcha doing
There is alot of controversie around if it was karl jenkins or Enya 	 Yes its a great song though apparantly the lyrics are all made up
It 's from the Rise of the Empire era 	 Oh I think I remember that one
Well they are a young team Maybe in the future it will be better 	 I would hope so
yes 	 What do you like about it
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
Me too I never knew you liked MJ 	 Of course I do He 's a legend What songs did he release under Motown Records
Have you ever heard of Ed Sheeran 	 Yes I have he is getting very popular
OH my god have you seen the parent trap 	 Is that the black and white one
Haha yeah it does 	 The late 2000s were a great time for romantic comedies actually
They created the British invasion 	 Well just for young women in the U.S.
Yes He is good at football 	 He is Will he win the MVP
Another interesting thing about Luke is the idea that he is the one we are more like while Han Solo is the one we want to be like 	 Yeah and can never be because he 's so impossibly cool
When do they play cowboys 	 October
It was filmed in Chicago 	 Ferris was a senior in high school
Who Emma 's shoes 	 Yes
The real slim shady please stand up 	 That 's a classic Was n't Brittany Spears still singing then
Ha that sounds really weird 	 It was weird It ends up that people were so poor that they were all living in their cars and either biked or ran to work
How good of a band do you think Taking Back Sunday is 	 Probably one of the better bands in todays music
Ok so who is your favorite rapper 	 I like many rappers for many reasons Some give me knowledge hope and drive others help me have a good time and never forget where Im from Im a big NAS fan
A lot of people like it I think 	 Yeah if we 're going by that standard then that Beatles song where he sings I am the Egg Man is pretty goofy too
These movies are made for him 	 Yes he is perfect in them
Yeah M Night made a few good movies with a twist in my opinion 	 This one reminds me of Sybil who i think had multiple personalities also Pretty much the same kinda split personalities genre with an M Knight flavor if you will
You should watch it It 's amazing 	 What is it about
But another type of film so prevalent these days animated you said you do n't seek those out either 	 Yes I 've been burned a couple times planning to go to a movie featuring one of my favorite actors only to find that they are just doing voiceover for an animated character
well true 	 I wouldnt hav been able to crawl through the sewer pipe
The Rockies crushed them 	 Yeah Alexi Amarista had a phenomenal game last night
I believe 	 That seems rather far away
Mayeb that 's why there are other schools of thoughts about it 	 And most other composers have developed their own systems
That 's probably why nobody wants a safety in the box anymore 	 It helps to have good run skills but you need to force turnovers
That was BSB I think Nick Carter was the lead on that one 	 Was n't his little brother famous too
Is there anything about the Star Wars films that stands out to you the most 	 If I had to choose one thing I 'd say the setting
Those two make a pretty great team Sweeney Todd is another favorite of mine 	 I 'm not usually much for musicals but I 've got to say that was one of the better ones that I 've seen
I think Lamar is good for more albums 	 Thats a sign of longevity in todays game
NOTHING I ALREADY HAVE LOTS OF SNACKS BUT THANKS 	 OK JUST LET ME NO A LITTLE HEAD OF TIME OK
I think so too it i an emotional roller coaster with comedy action and drama 	 I love showing my kids this movie because it makes them understand that even though you may be a little slow or a little different you can still succeed
No it has been released for a few years 	 I will have to check it out
That sounds like what I am looking for 	 It is what you are looking for Have you ever heard of Jungle Brothers
He really was the best Captain America 	 I liked the way he looked so wholesome like acted that way too
How long have they been together 	 They have been together since
Yes Sorry I did n't mean to Start over The epic saga of the most violent man who has ever walked the face of the earth the one who has had the dream of conquering the world since the death of His father onw who gleed at the thought of raping women and spreading his DNA over so widely in men descend directly from Kahn himself 	 That 's a stupid line for a movie It 's a science quote not a movie line
Have you seen it It made no sense 	 How so
Ziggy 's classic It 's amazing how much good music he produced in the 70s 	 I could listed to any one of his albums and love it
Yeah that was kinda stupid but then I guess those kind of people would n't change their outfits or would they 	 I do n't know but that therapist or psychiatrist was freaking dumb
Really Who was in the movie?Anyone that really stands out 	 It had Scarlett Johansson and a bunch of other actresses and actors I never heard about
She has a hard job 	 She is always busy
That one and the second one wow when the baby is all possessed 	 The Conjuring is another one
With girls that frail the men surely would have taken over 	 Sexist
Meh he 's ok I guess Rupert grint is my faster actor in the movies 	 Yeah he 's good that reminds me of the scene in the half blood prince where Ron drinks the love potion SO FUNNY
Lets talk about music 	 I love that topic
Yes kind of like the British Peter Paul and Mary 	 What were their hits
What did you think of the trench coat dress on Priyanka Chopra Can you believe it was Ralph Lauren Really dramatic but I kind of liked it 	 Yeah me too Who would have thought a British khaki at the Met Ball The collar is what really does it for me
I think that he represents the person who made rock popular But he definitely did n't invent it 	 Well who did then
Disney really 	 Yeah who 'd have thought that Disney would make a good Thriller movie
I also like It 's Dark and Hell is Hot 	 That 's a good one
You guess Do n't sound like a huge fan 	 I 'm not really I just thought it was okay
My favoriate of his was Nacho Libre 	 What is that about
What is the best Zeppelin song 	 Stairway to Heaven
Oh cool they 're cheaper as well 	 Yeah by almost three dollars Why are movies now a days
I know And of course I love some classic hip hop 	 What is classic for you in hip hop
Have you ever listened to Kacey Musgraves 	 I do n't think so What does she sing
I remember in that tv show the office they did a piece on it 	 Oh yeah it was in the intro with Dwight
He got one went out of the game came back in threw a touchdown and then went back off the field 	 He was dedicated
Yeah Chopin was a beast 	 You know who else Tchaikovsky
I am excited for the Panthers this year I think they will be fun to watch 	 Do you get to go to any games this season
Well that was considered great at the time but special effects have come a long way 	 Whatever happened to the main actor
That 's a classic 	 Have you seen them live
I absolutely love the cure 	 What do you like about that song specifically
Okay what would you say are the five best Sandler movies 	 Let me see In no order Little Nicky Big Daddy Grown Ups Jack and Jill That 's My Boy And honorable mention goes to The Ridiculous Six
Yes I was n't a huge fan of that movie I did like Adam Sandler in Mr. Deeds 	 He was pretty funny in that movie His character kind of reminded me of his character in Happy Gilmore
Wait Peter Gabriel was in Genesis 	 Yes but it 's been a long while
i might do that i am looking for something new afterall 	 it is a banger and is pretty good i think
Correct they had broken up in or 	 I think it was Sure glad they got back together for that album too
I do n't really Do you have any suggestions 	 Oh I do I have loved it since I was a kid Try Benny Goodman Glenn Miller or even Big Bad Voodoo Daddy
The one saying let it go or something 	 But that one is cute
I love that movie Did you see Finding Dory 	 No my kids are older and I did n't get to watch it
That was priceless 	 Are you ready or the next one to come out
Lets talk about music 	 Awesome i love music
You just planning on watching a bunch of his movies 	 Yea Beavis and Butthead Office Space and Idiocracy
I wish there was something more to listen to though 	 You know there is Have you heard of the Hamilton mixtape
Did you ever see that movie Moonstruck 	 I 'm not sure who was in it
Damien Wilson 	 The linebacker
Yes that 's the one 	 I 've seen several of them
They are pretty loyal in Oakland 	 I know you do n't get fans like them anywhere else
Have you ever heard of the band Wishbone Ash 	 I think I have
Yea she was mean and all that black ink that came out of her was cool 	 It had beautiful animation
What do you think of the NFL 's take on protecting the players now days 	 What do you mean
Kevin McNally is supposed to play a good role 	 Not sure who that is
What sucks is that they almost ALWAYS make it to the playoffs 	 Yeah I love Dalton I think he 's underrated
I agree there I think he might be the strongest player on the team 	 Yeah it 's a shame the rest of their team does n't play on his level
But it has to be inspired or it 's just flat 	 Flat Now you 're making sharp remarks
It was pretty good I had only a few complaints 	 Such as
And now we 're old and his stuff is still here 	 Just like we 're here for each other
It just used the same formula from the first 	 Dont all movies like that do it
I heard Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was pretty good 	 Yeah if you 're into Harry Potter types of stuff you 'll love it
I do n't know if I want to bother renting it Maybe I 'll wait until it comes on cable or something 	 I think if there are n't any other good recent movies that you have n't rented yet it might be worth a couple bucks to see it
I liked that one too It kind of seemed like everyone else did too It might be the most popular song from that record 	 You might be right I really liked Thunder too That was a great track
That looked so cheesy 	 It was the 80s Do n't forget his dancing skills
Yes that was a box office blunder 	 Secondly the retelling though not horrible was n't quite correct with the movies lore
Yes that part was hilarious 	 That 's my favorite part of the entire movie
Thats the story though 	 I guess the story itself is bloated
I can still listen to their old stuff sometimes 	 Sure Sunday Bloody Sunday holds up
It 's tough to choose I love their self-titled album I love Battle of Los Angeles and Evil Empire is great too 	 What about Renegades It 's cover songs but I really enjoyed it
yeah you know go hard 	 yeah he 's a dang good legend
Yep that 's the one Massive bomb at the box office 	 Does n't surprise me It looked horrible to start
Oh I suppose about the Patriots but the Ravens are n't very good 	 They are too
I loved other princess movies such as Cinderella Snow White and The Little Mermaid 	 I always sung the songs from Snow White on my way to school
I AGREE PLUS THE SEMI FINALS ARE NOT WATCHABLE ANYMORE 	 I HAVE STOPPED WATCHING BECAUSE THERE IS ZERO DRAMA NOW
Yea just because it 's so creative 	 Definitely there was no other movie like that
Of course I really like Sufjan Stevens and Bon Iver 	 I 've heard of Bon Iver but not Sufjan Stevens
Mine is Michael Jackson 	 Oh man he was the KING of POP Ca n't deny that much
You believe in one God but that 's been disproven We know it 's many gods But they 're all dead now 	 This is n't real
I know but if you had to choose who would be your top players 	 Well definitely Tom Brady
I have two tickets to their concert 	 Are you asking me to
Do you want to watch it together 	 I 'm really busy this week sorry
He should be more professional and make fewer mistakes with the team 	 So which team has impressed you this season
Well I think Oasis was convinced they were going to be the next Beatles for most of the nineties 	 I always forget about them
Awesome 	 It was a great season
Yeah Those were fun plus the folklore of the area 	 Yeah I did n't realize that the Hawaiian Islands were named after various deities or incidents

Guess I should start getting my costume together 	 Yeah you 've only got months

NFL Hall of Fame member Lynn Swann even credits his graceful performance in games in part to flexibility that he learned from ballet training and other dance classes adding that this training helped him achieve body control balance and a sense of rhythm and timing 	 Wow that 's cool they do n't let it effect their masculinity
They have strengthened the offensive line 	 Yes they did
I like the idea of a simple A-line dress with lace 	 That sounds lovely Long or short sleeves
For one thing a defensive lineman can no longer rush at the quarterback at full speed for fear he will get a personal foul and maybe even get fined and thrown out of the game 	 But that still happens How do these rules prevent that
Yes I feel like it is almost a match for Good Year for the Roses 	 Oh good point I love that song too

Well they have been doing really well That come back was insane 	 Yes It was I thought that game was the Falcon 's
I really like Sara Evans 	 What does she sing
His best spaghetti western 	 Yes but it still ranks up there with all of his movies
That sounds like a really cool way to watch 	 It is Also the stunts are crazy You never really know what you 're going to see
Do n't listen to that guy Trust me you 're better off watching the prequels first 	 So that 's Episodes I II and III right
Kind of It kind of progressed and went backwards all at once 	 I feel like I need some sort of graph or something showing what 's happening and when

I love when he turns to a liquid and walks through the iron bars 	 Sarah Conner was also a beast for a female character
Great music does n't chart it just is 	 Agreed
Oh no when I 'M done with the sounds there 's no way to recognize them 	 You run the ambient sounds you record through some kind of audio software
Yes but for that particular song Aerosmith did it better 	 I agree thank you for mentioning this I had forgot about this song
Exactly And then I 'd finish with The Force Awakens and Rogue One 	 Well luckily there is no wrong way to watch the series
Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day is very funny actually I want to watch it again 	 Sounds perfect Why do n't we do just that Who else is in that movie
I 've never heard of those Are they good 	 I think so
Mine too they are crazy over lightening mcqueen 	 My kids are partial to mater
She does n't need all the fireworks and huge sound effects and stuff to keep an audience does she 	 No just a piano and a microphone works for her
Ok I still put the Stones first And if you are going with groups then what about the Supremes 	 The Supremes Hermann 's Hermits the Mamas and the Pappas the list goes on But you said band
Most every song he does goes up the charts Seems like everyone likes it 	 I know Wagonwheel was popular too They played it to death on the radio
Remember that one artist from the 's that was super popular 	 You need to be more specific than that who do you mean
I do know 	 Ok Tell me When did the genre of Horror movies begin
No so far I know only about part releasing in April 	 Reminds me of Harry Potter 's last book and movies which were divided into two parts A long wait then for part
Did n't Waylong perform with Willie Nelson 	 He did way back in the day with Kris Kristofferson
I agree I also like Future as far as new hip hop 	 As do I though I think he has been slacking a bit lately
What sort of show 	 A pop music show duh

Hold on and I 'll get to that First look at the keyboard again Do you see that there are groups of two and then three black keys 	 Yes I see that and they repeat from the left side to the right side
Kyle Chandler too 	 Yeah But I think Casey Affleck 's character was meant to be the centerpiece of the movie
Who 's starring in the movie 	 There 's a couple well known people in it Naomi Watts plays the kid 's mom Sarah Silverman is her friend the little girl from Dance Moms Maddie Ziegler is the neighbor girl It also has a director who has done some good work Colin Trevorrow who did Jurrasic World But none of them are enough to save it from being a train wreck
It was great tailgating food I ate so much We had to bring our own alcohol though 	 Of course Is your job running any more trips

I think the league is racist 	 Now thats a terrible take

I really hope they show Freddy vs Jason that movie was so badass 	 Omg I know.That movie was a dream come true

That 's only about ten years old 	 Yes it was on T.V. so I kept it on
Iron Man for sure 	 Why
I mean I do n't see how it had anything to do with the original books other than the magic but it was okay 	 Oh That 's because it 's not really a prequel it happens like fifty years before the books
Have you heard her new album yet 	 I have It has a very different style than her last record
I really like his song Glory to Glory 	 Yes me too It gets you excited and hyped up

I am the same radio plays the same songs over and over 	 Yes it gets really old I have a lot of songs on my phone
Right now they have been road warriors They have one of the best road records in baseball 	 Yeah they have won and lost on the road so far

Yeah unfortunately it happened a lot back then 	 What else
For which team 	 The Giants
Wow thats a great question 	 I mean it has all the elements
We enjoy more popular type music and sometime the folk genre which is kind of like bluegrass is n't it 	 I guess somewhat There are a lot of new contemporary bluegrass artists nowadays such as Trampled by Turtles or Old Crow Medicine Show that are bringing awareness of bluegrass to the masses Ever heard of those
It was connected with writing a film 's musical score 	 What was his process
Yes I would enjoy that I 've heard the music is very good 	 It is Moana 's song sounds good
I du n no Something comedic 	 Nah I 'm not in the mood to laugh
Oh boy To be honest I ca n't remember the last animated movie I 've watched 	 I 've been watching a few lately with my family and I 've found some of them to actually be pretty good

It 's worth watching 	 Is there anyone else in the movie I might now

Yea he sure can and with the addition of Desean Jackson he has somebody he can count on down field 	 Yea that will help any quarterback and for him it definitely should
Oliver Company 	 You 're ridiculous
So what 's your favorite Steven Carell movie 	 Oddly enough probably Bruce Almighty which was Carell 's breakout hit AND it was a Jim Carey movie

Right So far the changes have not amount to a lot of time saving 	 Here is another time saver The catcher can only talk to the pitcher once an inning
What rap music have you been listening to lately 	 I have been hearing a lot of Stevie Stone
One of the Beatles Paul McCartney singing a duet with Stevie Wonder called Ebony and Ivory 	 That song was really popular
You 're right She is one of my favorite singers ever 	 She is up there on my list too I think I am going to listen to some more
I love all of the Big but I feel like newer bands do n't get enough credit 	 Because they are n't as good
It 's very polka-like often has a married couple dressed in dirndl and Lederhosen trilling about love or country 	 Hahaha sounds absurd
Yes it is so funny and even dramatic at times 	 Ok that sounds like a good film
They were really expecting him to be the future ace of their staff 	 Exactly I do n't know what there next move will be but they need to do something
Ahhh right Outerwear is often more flexible 	 For shoes I think I 'd have to pick boots You can also wear those in any weather
Carl Elwyes 	 Yes I mean the character he plays not the actor
Oh right for the steelers 	 Yea he 's amazing
It has to be Something About Mary 	 Is that the one with Cameron Diaz
Well that is a hard one since there has not really been any good choices 	 What do you mean
Sure i guess 	 Get some enthuisim
They cite player safety and the fact that only or so of games the last few seasons had overtimes that went longer than that 	 I guess that makes sense But I do wonder if we 'll see more tie games now
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
Yes like Apollo after he fought Drago 	 At least Rocky ended the Cold War at the end of Rocky IV
I think Tom Brady should retire 	 Why do you think that
They made strange noises 	 It was scary when they attacked Luke
The first NFL for this season 	 Whos playing
What made you ask me that 	 I was watching it last night Did you see it

They should all play at least once before the playoffs 	 I know it makes no sense that they do n't
Are n't they in their 70s now 	 They have to be They started in the 60s
I was thinking it 'd have to be him or Willie Mays 	 You 're right that 's a coin flip

I introduced my boyfriend to Star Wars over the weekend He had never seen them before 	 That 's crazy What did he think
So good We have to see him in concert when he 's in town 	 I ca n't wait
Oh yes I saw him in concert with Annie Lennox one time 	 Really
Jordan completely dominated the game offensively and defensively He made a good team and great team by getting double and triple teamed making it easier for his teammates to score 	 Do you think Lebron will continue to improve and evolve his game
Yea I never get sick of their music 	 It certainly has been around for a long time
Probably because of the special effects 	 Yeah those have definitely come a long way
He has been such an influence on so many players coming up in the organization 	 Not only in that specific organization but in the world of baseball
He 's starting to remind me of Jordan 	 How is that
I do n't think so Everything goes badly in the end 	 Only sort of though

My Neighbor Totoro like I said Also Kiki 's Delivery Service is really good 	 Okay That looks cute too
Yes I liked it but it was quite sad throughout but with a happy ending 	 Why what happened
I keep hearing it everywhere even Justin Bieber has a version of the song 	 Oh yeah I heard it and I like it
All you have to do is show them what 's great about it and they 'll slowly tune in 	 That sounds like a good idea The video for Black Hole Sun was awesome
Yeah I only watch some of the Hall of fame game most years 	 I 've seen that before I do watch a lot of highlights on ESPN during that time
Well one can hope maybe he will get an offer he ca n't refuse one day 	 Do you have any opinions on the Redkins name controversy
They both only got like yards combined 	 both the giants and the ravens were fun to watch last season

Ever listen to Enya 	 As embarrassing as it is to admit this yes Yes I do listen to Enya
Was that a horrror 	 Not a typical one But I thought it could fall into that category or thriller Scary enough for me
Well it is pretty cool when they do break away and go down the court to make a nice play 	 Like what
Yea they are 	 How so
I like Frozen Ray of Light Like a Prayer Vogue You 	 My favorite songs are Ray of Light True Blue and Who 's that girl
Well i disagree too 	 Why
Concrete and Gold They have a tour starting too to promote it 	 Really we should go see them
It 's about a guy who goes to England and gets caught up in a espinoge type scenario 	 Why did he know too little

Oh that 's a tough question I 'd have to think about it 	 Well they can be from any of his albums or any mixtapes and singles
I do too I love all of the Elvis songs 	 I keep forgetting that he had a major impact in Hawaii Explains why Lilo is so fond of him
Me too 	 They have had some really good players over the years
Tell me about it 	 Yup our Packers are going to dominate I can feel it
Yeah I remember having an ET figurine It was a little plastic toy 	 Yeah a lot of places gave out glasses and stuff
I agree it must be a really difficult challenge to make a film like that especially for the actress 	 Although to be honest I think it probably caused other parts of the film to suffer
No just different 	 Ah okay
So do i 	 I want to see wonderwoman
It was yeah people were going crazy they always put on a good light show 	 Did you like their latest album A Moon Shaped Pool
My guess is they start talking about that in this movie and the next one fully comes out with the why 	 I 'm interested myself It 's one of the character narratives we do n't understand quite yet
Oh man Afroman 's Palmdale I would like sit at home and play that song for hours 	 Never heard of it all I know is that song Because I Got High
True Though at some point it has to end 	 No no it does n't
That does make for a more romantic ending Although this movie ended a little different 	 I also love a good time travel movie This one had a little bit of that going on
They have Wi-Fi and update score boards there 	 That is cool
It 's not supposed to be it 's supposed to be a horror film 	 Does he make it funny
Leia should be a calming influence on him 	 I bet the kids will be a handful

They sound so good as a duet too 	 They do
Well give me a suggestion 	 Well how about something like Black Flag
Is Solange a singer-songwriter I thought she was just a singer 	 No she writes all of her own material
I 've got a few others if you wan na see 	 Nah I guess I 'm in a Muppet mood

Which Star Wars heroine do you like the most 	 I really like Rey but Princess Leia will always be my favorite heroine
I have Storyteller that is the one that she released in 	 Which songs would I know that are on that album
So what does the bad guy do then 	 He manufactures artificial kryptonite to try and kill Superman but it does n't work quite right
I 'd be willing to be that they will move him all over the formation 	 They are so loaded on offense they 're 3rd stringers would start for most teams
I just loved the friendship they shared I also loved the way they designed Stitch 	 I 'll agree Stitch was a great character idea
Like what 	 I love love love The Carpenters My mom liked them
Who has cohosted the football morning show 	 Steven A has guess hosted but they have had a few NFL players like Linsalto and Johnson
I 've heard of them A fairly new group I like is Twenty One Pilots 	 Yes they are alright Some of their lyrics are very thought provoking
I liked that one a lot too Pretty incredible storyline and think ti is based on a real guy 	 Hard to believe the acting was really great in it too Patel has been on my radar since the movie slumdog millionaire
I want to see them live too We should see where then they are touring and pick up tickets 	 Let 's make it a party I bet we can find a bunch of people who want to see Halestorm
His spin move was the best in the game 	 I agree with that it was great
What Blasphemy 	 Yeah I know I know but I just like the darker edge of the original

They would be worth a pretty penny some of them 	 I know
Yes it is so refreshing and exciting when it does happen 	 Timothy Hutton is the only famous actor in it that I knew
Well when you have Jordy Nelson and Julio Jones to throw to I imagine it 's like playing backyard football 	 Both Aaron and Matt just naturally like to air it out but having such great receivers means a nightmare situation for both defenses
Wonder if they could do anything about that 	 First possession in the Super Bowl for the conference that wins the Pro Bowl maybe
Do you think Luke will train Rey to be a Jedi 	 I bet he will
It 's an unintentional comedy or maybe even an intentional comedy we will never know 	 That I can see but it 's such an odd choice
Especially since they are more realistic than the animated ones 	 For sure we 'll have to see how those go
I do too Especially if there are fights 	 I wish they would play year round
Maybe although Cam Newton is the type of player that does front flips into the end zone I think that he will continue to put himself at risk for injury 	 Newton 's size definitely contributes to his fearlessness while playing However I feel that the combination of Christian McCaffrey Greg Olsen and a healthy Kelvin Benjamin will allow him to distribute the ball more
He was awesome 	 The makeup was amazing
My husband is from St. Paul so we root for Minnesota against Packers 	 It will be an interesting season I think

The guy that dates Lena Dunham 	 Yeah that 's the one
Disney movies are so heartwarming 	 Thats why i love them
Right It was irritating though there was room for him 	 Well it may have tipped over you never know

I agree 	 You should be able to do what you want when you want
Oh so it sort of gets to know my preferences 	 Yes exactly and plays music that it think you will like
Did n't Dak get in trouble this off season 	 Yeah for using a robot to sign his autograph
Do you like the Band Huey Lewis and the News 	 I love Heuy They were my favorite band in high school

What did you think about it 	 I liked it I thought that it was more interesting than most movies out today
She sure is She will be only the 3rd wife to present to her husband 	 Oh I remember when Farve wife did that last year I think it is a good idea

The new director was fantastic and it showed immediately 	 I was not even aware it was a new director The films there after did have a new feel
Have you ever seen the movie Smokin Aces 	 No tell me about it
present day teams I would love to see the Saints take on Atlanta Falcons 	 Saints versus Falcons really Who would you root for
Did you see that new comedy Fist Fight 	 No I have n't got a chance yet Who is in that
He 'll fight Kylo Ren and get revenge for him killing Han Solo in Force Awakens 	 OK number one Jedi 's do n't get revenge that leads to the dark side Number two he should be able to take out Kylo Ren in about two seconds
I do n't think so 	 Do you think they have a chance this year
I know It seems he is most famous for Ring of Fire Walk The Line and Folsom Prison Blues 	 I agree A Boy Named Sue is pretty popular too
Is that the song that samples Sting 's Shape of My Heart 	 That is the one
So what team are you rooting for 	 I 'd like to see Lebron win again but I do n't really care about the team What about you
They extended their manager 	 Oh wow thats a surprise
Jack is good I just worry about him with injuries 	 True if he stays healthy though he should be solid
Neither was I He could sing and dance well though 	 What happens in the end
Yes she is a well rounded actor 	 Well I have to go soon to work
True but maybe we could find a page or twitter or something to follow so we 'll know if he does 	 Oh I just googled it he has a web site
I would n't go that far but I would say that I 'd rather focus on the album 's better songs such as Blank Space Style and Wildest Dreams 	 I would agree that Blank Space was the album 's best song but Style and Wildest Dreams are mediocre at best
Yep It did really well too 	 I never knew that
At least in the end he gets one 	 You like Arnold Schwarzenegger
This sounds really good I 'm going to give it a shot you sold me on it 	 I 'm glad Tell me what you think once you 've caught it oh and another recent movie I watched that was amazing was John Wick Chapter
Yes To me the blues is all about the historical moment in which artists like John Lee Hooker lived 	 It 's interesting because did n't those artists sort of come out of retirement in the 1960s
What 's your favorite memory of little league 	 That 's a tie of two things First I hit a grand slam in a field with no fences
Who cares he and some guy started a billion dollar business in their garage 	 Why do you care
Ah I think that 's the Little Mermaid 	 I 've never heard of that one
You have to admit that they make some catchy music 	 I do admit that However for my personal taste even catchy music is n't enjoyable if the lyrics are unbearable
Her album that came out in a Very Gaga Holiday was beautiful 	 She has an amazing voice What are your favorites on that record
Yea with the millenium Falcon 	 Yea that ship is old but it packs a punch
Like Apollo in Rocky IV 	 Yes like Apollo after he fought Drago
No I have n't Why 'd you like it so much What 's it about 	 Theron plays a character called Agent Lorraine Broughton a British spy during the Cold War The movie is set just before the fall of the Berlin Wall in and Agent Broughton has to team up with a German agent to take on a threat to Western Intelligence
I dont know if they need to 	 Yeah they could keep him around forever
Okay you can listen to rock and I will try out rap 	 Sounds good
That was so funny especially when Kilmer skates around and says no one signed up for there competition 	 Also when they trick Kent thinking he was talking to God
Do n't get me wrong marino Montana and fouts are great and all but I have a hard time saying any of these guys are the GOAT Could you imagine Johnny Unitas playing in a West coast offense Joe Namath playing in the air coryell Otto Graham playing after the Mel Blount rule You ca n't touch recievers anymore 	 I do n't think you can really put a value on taking a pounding
Really I wonder if they still can jam like they did years ago 	 I am sure they still sound great
Which actors played them do you know 	 One was Joe Pesci and another was Daniel Stern
Yeah youre right it was about the Group 	 Did you like Straight out of Compton
Any and all kinds of music Just the best singer 	 I have to go with Whitney Houston
No the immortality thing is maybe a bit frightening That 's why Wendy ultimately has to return home 	 Maybe Peter should have taken a page from her book
It was Ronda Rousey man you know the Champion UFC chick 	 Whoa really that just makes it even cooler
He knew what he was doing to have an empire that big 	 How about the ending
How so It 's background music 	 You 'd pay a DJ You pay Taylor Swift when you hear her concerts live
Yes this one is a great motivator and inspiration for life 	 I like that music can give us energy
I think Calvin Harris has something new coming out 	 I 'm not a big Calvin Harris fan my favourite song of his was that one with Rihanna I just liked Rihanna not Calvin
I actually am not a fan of either teams I got free tickets and I lived in Indiana at the time 	 You 're not a fan of the team in your state
Never heard of it What 's it about 	 Three short horror films directed by three separate East Asians
Yes I did 	 I really liked it
You too 	 Thanks
I think Dak Prescott may challenge him this year 	 He did play great last year But we will see if he can keep playing at that caliber
NOW I 'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT SERIES MATCH UP 	 YEP TWO OF THE BEST TEAMS IN THE WESTERN CONFERENCE WILL NOT FAIL TO ENTERTAIN
I know there is nothing to do on this stormy day 	 I have an idea Since it is storming out do you want to watch a scary movie
You also sometimes hear flute and clarinet I believe 	 Do you know any other good jazz musicians
How so 	 The movies are intertwining with one another
Tampa could win that division this year They have a lot of talent on offense 	 Yes Jameis Winston and Mike Evans will continue to put up big numbers
I just saw The Force Awakens 	 Who directed it
so why did you watch it 	 because the home team eagles had made it to the championship
Groncowski 	 Not sure what his name is actually
At least as far as classical for sure He of course composed all his songs 	 Not like today 's artists Some of them do but usually they have a group to revise them now
I dont either 	 Its an awful idea
I do n't think I heard of Thunder Rose who were they 	 They were a psychedalic band from the 1960s Nirvana covered a lot of their work
Makes sense Down is a pretty catchy song 	 Not to mention it 's really unique It has an awesome drop
I loved the scene where he ran through the art museum steps 	 Thats the worst in my opinion
Yeah the great 	 Yes that 's him
Oh cool what kind of music 	 It is EDM
That is a really cool way to move around 	 And you ca n't forget about Mystique who can be anyone she wants
Bat Out of Hell is by far the best album of time 	 From Meatloaf right
I know I loved him in Stand By Me and The Lost Boys 	 I loved to hate him in those films
Actually no It 's because he would travel by train to out of town games because he was afraid of flying 	 I would not have guessed that one
Me too but I like City of Stars better 	 I liked that one a lot too That movie was perfect in every way
I never knew that Johnny Depp can sing like that 	 I know is there anything that guy ca n't do I did n't care much for his interpretation of Willy Wonka though
They used to be so unapolagetic in a witty and confrontational way 	 Like with I 'm Not Ashamed and God is Not a Secret
Yeah you can also listen to Prince Royce 	 What 's the most famous song from Prince Royce
I wonder if they shot the movie in any places we know 	 Yeah I was looking for the office building we work haha
Especially because he 's so young too 	 Yeah I think he 's only
Who knows they will probably end up rebooting the whole franchise for the next generation of kids waiting to be terrorized 	 Well i 'll be on deck waiting to buy a ticket myself
Oh many what a victory 	 Yikes so does that mean they 're up
I used to have that cd 	 Do you still have it
I HAVE N'T HEARD OF THEM BEFORE 	 YEAH I HEAR THAT A LOT THEY ARE A ROCK/GOTHIC KIND OF BAND THEY DO LOVE SONGS AND THEY ARE VERY POETIC
I know right When does it stop 	 It is always the same type guys too the free agents or the rookies that just signed big contracts saying they could have gotten more if they played basketball
They scrapped it at the end as they wanted a happier ending 	 Darn I love that kind of stuff
I do n't really care about the actors much I just like the nostalgia about it 	 Ah I see what you mean
They were pretty good Did you hear that Guns and Roses got back together and are on tour 	 I did hear that I saw a clip of one of their concerts on YouTube They still sound pretty good
Well I do n't want to give it all away 	 How about the good scenes
So do you listen to katy perry 	 I have heard few songs of her
Me too Her album Platinum is so good though 	 What is your favorite album on Platinum
Man your hard to please 	 Not really but I remember when music and hip hop were real
I helped Cam get a lot better when we used to practice 	 Oh Cam is great now That was ouy helping him
That 's easy Darth Vader all the way 	 He was just awesome Maybe the best bad guy in movie history
Yes 	 Did you think it would end that way
So cool I only saw maroon five live 	 I want to see them too
Yeah everything I 'd heard about it sounded so depressing but the book was funny in a very natural way 	 I never would have guessed
Yeah them and also 's stuff 	 Oh like gangsta rap
Yeah I liked those too 	 Was n't Do n't based on a true experience
That should be good He is a great actor Anyone else 	 I am not too sure but it is another Stan Lee production
I have to agree I remember I loved that album so much I learned how to play the songs on guitar 	 That is cool I 've always wanted to learn guitar but I never have
Yeah He 's really young but has a lot of talent 	 He must be good because it looks like he has his own tour
I agree with AB Leveon and Martavis the offense is primed to perform 	 It seems like we 've been saying that for a while now
I 'm hoping the Green Bay Packers will get there 	 Aaron Rodgers is obviously going to be good but how is their defense going to be
No not really I just wanted to watch the game but was exited to see that comeback 	 I know it was pretty cool we were all down becaues we thought that Patrios were going to lose
Nope I 've never read them either 	 That 's crazy Everyone has
No man I totally agree 	 Cool cool
The Bespin Cloud City backgrounds were pretty cool even if they looked like paintings 	 Definitely I 'd like to live in Bespin Cloud City
Yea they have been around since the eightees 	 That 's a long time
I just saw Wonder Woman and it was pretty good 	 Well I 'm not really into super hero movies
Me too What about you Whats your favorite band 	 I do n't really have a favorite but I 've been really into Smash Mouth lately
Why is that 	 The music was haunting and the scenes were quite somber with the dementors surrounding Hogwarts and Snape silently watching the students in their marching formation
Yeah you remember the last game 	 Yeah that was way back In
We had Dwight Freeny as our defense end 	 Dwight was a great player
Tad the band 	 Yes the band the lead singer used to be a butcher
No but the musical is set in high school and they 're in high school 	 Who wrote the music for Dear Evan Hansen
What about yours 	 When Jason Statham 's character takes on the entire plane while keeping an eye on the baby
Like Bach 	 Yeah I like Bach sometimes
That is true But these days I still like old classics like Zeppelin and Twisted Sister 	 Well i 'm going to go listen to some Metallica s enter sandman now
They are always hard for me to pick They can go or and I never know what they will do 	 Eli should be Eli again td and INT But that 's good enough for second and a playoff spot
James Brown Aretha Franklin Dan Atkroyd and John Belushi starred in what famous music movie 	 The Blues Brothers was the movie Aretha Franklin sang Respect and james Brown sang Living For America
Superbowl team 	 We 'll see I do n't think so I think Wentz needs to mature a bit and we need an all-star running back or wide receiver
Ok what do you consider REAL country 	 Cody Jinks Zac Brown Chris Stapleton Any of the Red Dirt country musicians
Yeah J-Law is more of a nice character completely changed 	 Well it is a different time-line
Yes I love it What about you 	 I prefer Ray of Light
I know but it came out on Dec so it 's basically a album 	 Fair enough That was a really solid album
And then they shuffle in the next round 	 Irving will be there but I dont know about JR Smith

Are you talking about old classic ones or newer scary ones 	 Whichever just the scariest movie you 've ever seen
Well he was the exception 	 And ewoks
I think it was in That 's when was released right 	 Wow Was it really that long ago It feels like that album was just released a few months ago
Yeah but I 'm insecure All the skinny young things with their ponytails bouncing and nothing else 	 Oh nobody sees us Let 's go
Which song did you find acceptable lyrics from 	 My mom let me bring Cheeseburger in Paradise She said those lyrics should be fine for school
But there was only one in this series You know I really love to see a bunch 	 Yeah I know it 's both of our favorite parts of the game
Right I have n't seen that one yet 	 Which one of the ones you 've seen is your favorite
My wife wo n't like that very much 	 What she does n't know
I 'm just happy he 's still making music after all these years so many stop or take long breaks but he really has n't 	 He 's had a break or two here and there but it was n't for long stretches and he always comes back
What was the first real record or album you got 	 What do you mean by real
He turns out to be the murderer 	 Wow he used to play nice guy roles
Did you like it 	 Yes it was really good full of action Have you seen it
Yeah that was tragic He was the lead singer of Audioslave also 	 Yes I love their song Like A Stone That 's my favorite from them
That 's great If you do n't mind I will listen to it after you purchase it 	 I would like that
Yes they loved it I thought it was cute 	 Are there any movies out now that you would like to see
It is actually related with the subject of their singing 	 Why do you say that
She has a lot of really good music 	 I think her videos are really different
Was n't that a remake of Dial M for Murder 	 Yes it was
Bb is B is C is C# is and is D Then the original Bb G C# C is what 	 So it will be D C F E
Yes set closer to the time he was actually like a secret agent 	 I love the action in them So much all the time
If you crave a white Chistmas there 's Smilla 's Sense of Snow 	 What 's that about
Do you like their music 	 Yes I love their music especially at the end of song Beth
Well just the two but they 've been around since or so and have released several albums since then 	 I see Where are they from
I 'm ready for Manning to come back 	 Yea it was a long season for the Broncos without him
He really does n't realize how good he had it there I mean he got everything he needed plus the protection from his mother 	 You 're right He never does seem truly grateful for them
yeah that is the smart thing to do but when the money calls you got ta take it while you can 	 This is true
They are very good at giving recommendations They seem to know what you like 	 They will probably sound just as awesome in concert A large component of their music is electronic
Oh I love that song I also like just give me a reason 	 That song is good
Yeah shows like Book of Mormon coming out the type of music at Broadway shows it is totally different these days 	 How often do you get to the theater
So do I. I 'd love to cultivate the type of powers he had that 's for sure 	 That scene with Dormammu was hilarious with the time loop That would have driven anyone crazy
I agree that there is never a boring moment in that movie 	 Sally Field is also great in that movie
I like a lot of different comedies 	 If you could pick one what would it be
Cleveland Browns are about on the same level they look like brown and orange candy corn 	 I like Green Bay and Pittsburgh Steelers uniforms They make a statement
It 's surprising that she is n't in more movies I think she 's a great actress 	 I agree but we ca n't control Hollywood
What do you think is the worst uniforms in the NFL 	 An obvious answer would be the Browns because of the colors However I would say the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
What 	 Thats just something i forgot
Yes love music 	 Okay lets talk about that then
Haha That 's hilarious I was thinking about making better visuals for the empire strikes back but you made a really good point 	 Yeah its ridiculous how stupid the love scenes are with annakin its no surprise that actor is not in any other movies
I know some of them are getting up there though 	 Right Like Brady and Palmer They are gon na need some new QB 's
I think it helped that they had a Broadway star singing the main song 	 Oh true Idina Menzel was amazing
Well then i would pick sith 	 Why is that
I think a band like chevelle or hinder would sound great with them 	 I would also like to hear some of the older stuff that did not make the cd cuts
What do you think of Carrie Underwoods album Blown Away 	 Dont know much about it
Strawberry fields in a nice song as well 	 I like to zone out and drive to that one
Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink was my favorite character 	 The whole aspect of the heist and crime elements were so powerful
I used to listen to them all the time 	 Me too
Do you know if he 's going to be touring 	 I know he 's doing the Vans Warped Tour
I do My favorite song of his is such great heights 	 That was a good one What was that film it was in
Good morning 	 Hello
That 's cool I play the piano 	 I started playing the violin at age seven What age did you start playing the piano at
Granted he was on the verge of being a teenager He did n't have time for a love story I guess 	 Oh that 's really funny
Are n't you excited 	 Meh
Oh wow yeah that is impressive Tell me more about him 	 He had a solo album in called the Chronic it was pretty amazing too
Maybe They might be a year or two away from that 	 True but they are definitely turning the corner
Yes that movie 	 No I actually have n't seen it yet Is it any good
Where can I hear more of this stuff 	 Just google it
I can make them today 	 I ca n't wait I 'll advertise your page for you too

Me too I watched it on netflix 	 There are so much controversies surrounding that movie too
Now that I 'm thinking about it I do n't know if I can wait that long 	 Haha well if you decide to wait let me know
Imperial Star Destroyers are like battleships That 's really cool 	 They 're more like aircraft carriers They carry TIE Fighters
On why Leia and Han abandoned him 	 Well the did n't abandon him but he obviously did n't grow up how they anticipated
Hey 	 Hello
Man I wish I could find a movie like Superbad 	 Superbad is great have you tried any of Judd Apatow 's movies
Okay so what 's the dilemma 	 Even though he 's the obvious best TE I ca n't rely on him
They even toured with Weezer check them out they are great 	 Ok thank you for telling me about them
Have you been keeping up with the games lately 	 To some extent You
He 's lame 	 Self consciously low brow is the most condescending thing
Yeah ok 	 You do n't love their songs like Hey Jude and Yellow Submarine
It has to be John Lennon definitely because I love the song Imagine 	 What other song from them are you passionate about
You should listen to it 	 I will do that
To be honest I 'm not sure All I know is that the guys I heard were really old and really good at playing Jazz 	 I 'm glad you liked it but I do n't really like Jazz that much so I do n't think I 'll ever go there
Morgan Freeman was the only one I recognized 	 Was n't that a wild ending
There are so many good actors in Hollywood these days 	 I know do you have a favorite
Have you heard him play Malegue√±a It 's not country that 's for sure 	 No I do n't think so Is it on acoustic or electric
Stop by a punk why are you scared so easy 	 It just gives me nighmares and I 'd rather not watch them at night
I think it will be Derek Carr 	 I think that Russel Wilson will win it
honestly it was okay 	 a lot of people seemed to love it i guess you dont
yes that 's funny me too My sister loves Sergeant Pepper 's album 	 That is a good one When I was a kid my dad brought home the White Album I had never seen a white record before
Luke does n't have those excuses does he Maybe Snoke did beat him 	 If that 's the case then they have to show it It 's also implausibly Luke was one of the best

Oh yeah Robin Williams as the Genie he stole the show for sure 	 Yeah What about you
Yes I really liked their first band The Format though 	 I have n't heard of them What would you recommend
Who else have you seen in concert 	 Well they are n't country but my very first concert was Maniacs I also saw Sawyer Brown Toby Keith Alan Jackson Tim McGraw and Faith Hill
Ya I thought it was selena gomez at first 	 I like that a potential new pop sensation is emerging

I 've heard his later stuff is not as good 	 Yeah most would agree I think Marnie is probably his last good movie
Do you like David Lynch 	 Yes
Kansas City is usually tough 	 Arrowhead Stadium is a tough stadium to play in as a visitor

What 's your favorite NFL division 	 I am partial to the AFC
What is your favorite Star Wars movie 	 I really like Return of the Jedi
Do you happen to know something 	 Know what
And Deron Williams playing the point guard position off the bench is a huge benefit for them as well 	 Well we are discussing the Cavaliers right now but what about the Warriors
I hope so They had an EP that came out last year and I heard they are recording a new album right now 	 Reptilia was such a good song I hope they have another track like that on their next release
Ca n't wait I 've been dying to watch my Packers play again 	 Do you think they will make it to the super bowl this year

Pretty much Though life is not easy on the train 	 I can imagine not So would you call it a science fiction movie
So who is your favorite NFL coach 	 Well with no doubt it is Bill Cower
Me too He really is impressive with his moves 	 You may come to like the whole team
I do love christopher nolan But I feel like this is one of his weaker films 	 I enjoyed this movie a lot But I did feel maybe it was slightly long or the pacing could have been faster
It was too much of a slow song 	 I could see that
Yeah him he was a pretty chill actor in the movies 	 Overall yea he was a good actor
there is this song i ca n't get out of my head 	 which one
I believe it is not the usual A list of actors but I am not certain either 	 Or should I just wait until I can see it online
Do you like Beauty and the Beast better too then 	 No I like it a lot but I actually prefer The Little Mermaid
Those three are awesome and all but I do not think they compare with Reba 	 We will just have to agree to disagree on this issue then
I thought so too Emma Watson was n't really that great in it to me though 	 Really I thought she was exactly how Belle should act
What 's this one called 	 The Last Knight
The story all in all was a bit weak 	 I think that the whole digital world concept is tired
I think so Did n't they make With or Without You 	 Yes that was them
That 's actually a better message than a lot of boy bands had sometimes 	 Right I always thought so
It 's not a good movie but it is very entertaining 	 What 's so entertaining about it
No he hated the kid 's dad He was an adult jeez 	 He also wanted it to look like he hated him to Voldmort
I just do n't think LeBron can handle it all on his own Kyrie will step up but they really need Kevin Love this year now that the Warriors are even more loaded 	 I guess so I still do n't think anyone is stopping LeBron He will average a triple double in the finals I guarantee it
I am really torn on this one both teams have been dominant this post season 	 To me the Cavaliers have been by far the most impressive team in the entire NBA playoffs

A little bit It was rather depressing 	 I could not believe they blew such a big lead

They usually burn out at 	 I think he will last longer than that though
Yeah 	 That one 's kinda weird
Yes Let 's go see it tonight 	 I ca n't tonight let 's go tomorrow
I think it 's because Spoon is at it 's best when there is a lot of space They are known for that 	 That makes sense I love Britt 's gritty guitar
I think I loved every single thing she said in those movies 	 She was always the voice of reason
What do you mean 	 Mulan has nothing to do with the actual story of Mulan
Yeah blows 	 Come over we can ball talk
You really should Ju-on is much better than it 's American remake 	 I know that was the case with The Ring
You 'll have to watch the movie 	 I plan on it When did you see it
Indeed and I did n't even mention that some players will play elsewhere around the world in the winter also 	 That 's crazy That probably almost baseball games a year one player could play
Me either I tend to just watch TV at home but he really wants to go Help 	 Ok let 's look up something What type of movies does he like
I mean is it a respected part of the canon and up to the same quality as the others 	 It definitely is It 's politically a very interesting movie
Oh I have seen those they are a lot of fun 	 They are fun but I think that Wonder Woman is even better for her She gets to really show her skill
Melissa is someone that you would watch in almost any movie 	 I 've seen Kristen in several movies She does have a certain sensitivity
Right I ca n't wait to see Spidey fighting side-by-side with Iron-Man 	 There could not have been a better choice for Iron-Man than Robert Downey Jr.
It felt like it dragged on and then the ending became predictable about halfway thought the movie 	 I hate when I can guess the movie endings I love being surprised
It 's gon na be a exciting season 	 For sure
But is that going to be enough to change their fortunes next year 	 It might take a couple of years and a few more good drafts
So seen any good movies lately 	 Yeah I saw Guardians of the Galaxy
But to be surrounded by the movie 	 Is great But is n't worth twenty dollars
Did you know that comedian Eddie Murphy recorded a hit song 	 Eddie Murphy The guy who used to be on Saturday Night Live

Who sang the National Anthem 	 Natalie Cole
Clearly that was his wife who decided that they needed to shine bright tonight 	 What a great show we are seeing tonignt at the Met Gala right
Hang time What do you mean by that 	 For some reason if he and another player jumped at the same time he seemed to stay up in the air longer and it gave him an advantage
Just a five nine beautiful tall I looked it up one day Well I heard somebody shooting a gun 	 Thank you I thought it was When I heard something I should n't have known
Again I do n't know but I 'd give money to see Marshawn Lynch talking to reporters after that game 	 That would be entertainment enough Speaking of Beast Mode what about the Seahawks
I really love his holiday album It 's called Faith 	 Yeah I like the Auld Lang Syne song
The Tennesee Titans they are certainly underrated coming into the season and adding more weapons how about you 	 I 'd have to say the Arizona Cardinals they 've got a strong core who had an off-year I think they 'll be back to the Big Dance
Well in the first one you see where Harry is starting out Actually you get to see where all the kids come from 	 Even all those red headed ones That part was confusing
They are smoking hot DId you see how far Gallo 's home run traveled 	 Yeah feet He crushed that ball
Time turner BY far you could go and do whatever you want 	 Do you prefer The Movies or the book
I think one of the major flaws was the relationship between Amidala and Anakin It was n't credible 	 I know it was kind of weird that Amidala was so much older than Anakin
That is pretty recent 	 They have Wi-Fi and update score boards there
Yeah tickets were super affordable 	 How was the concert
What do you think about Metallica releasing a new album 	 I have enjoyed their music in the past but some of it has not been very good
Yes My grandma has all of his work on vinyl 	 Wow she 's really a fan
I did n't know there were two 	 Yes the same people were the paranormal investigators
I know 	 Like why did we even get him
Well if there 's one thing Miley knows how to do it 's stand out 	 I doubt she 'd do anything like have them appear naked on a wrecking ball but I hope she would have them be more adventurous with their costumes
No it 's kinda jazzy They meet with other cats to sing 	 Is it towards the end of the movie
I agree but I bet those Thursday night games get them more money 	 No doubt Any other rule changes
Yes but they 've only been around a few years longer than the Predators 	 Who is playing in the eastern conference finals
I love them 	 Are they your favorite team
Yeah and you can tell vader is at his breaking point with them 	 The probe droids were key in it
Its been sixteen years since he played for the avengers 	 Thats what I mean
Yeah it is one of the best horror movies ever made 	 Who directed it
Yeah I think that the fact it 's dedicated to Paul Walker makes it even sadder for me 	 I can see that definitely
Hello 	 Whats good
I LIKE B.B KING BO DIDLY MUDDY WATERS 	 I LIKE RUFUS THOMAS JOHN LEE HOOKER AND BIG MAMA THORTON
Yeah that movie is lovely 	 i like it
A movie is an art form by consensus most film historian agree that the very first movie was introduced around 	 That 's a convenient nice rounded number
Words Ever seen them live 	 Oh yeah man many times What about you

Remember Sex and Candy and Better than Ezra 	 Oh man Better than Ezra Good I used to blast that song So dumb
Speak to a girl 	 I love that one
How much can we spend 	 How much does a new wardrobe cost
She made the perfect Belle 	 She 's one of my favorite actresses so I did n't want to disappoint myself if I did n't like the movie
She was also really great in the chick flick Me Without You 	 I know That one tends to slip through the cracks
Ya he still played well 	 Did he dunk
How 's that work 	 I do n't know they are high on Jesus
Yea I though it was different so I watched it but it did not really compare with the classic Shakespeare movies 	 Who is your favorite actor
John C. Reilly 	 That guy is so funny
Do n't tell me it 's about Jaba the Hut 	 No but close It 's about Luke Skywalker
What 's your favorite Reo Speedwagon song 	 There 's so many Keep pushin is one of them
Yea like the bar room scene when he was dancing on the bar with all the bikers watching 	 Yea but the best was LARGE MARGE
I think they have a pretty good chance 	 The team has potential but it 's not the same since all the good players are gone
I think I may do the same I could use more music on my phone when I travel 	 What other music are you into
No he does n't 	 He is not liked by many people
Well it 's not as much a war movie as some mainly because it 's centered around a Quaker family but it does take place during the American civil war 	 Interesting Anybody good in it
Ya mine too I really liked how intense it was 	 That was my thought I saw it twice in the theater
Yo you ready for the next nfl season 	 HECK YEAH I AM
They keep getting better and better every year 	 Right so maybe this year will be the year the whole team actually makes it past the 1st playoff game
I feel that if he had better defenses over the years he would have gotten a few more of those rings 	 I agree with you one hundred percent about that
Of course That 's practically genetic 	 Rivalries like that are always so funny to me
Really Im a big fan as well 	 What do you like most about them
Yes it does 	 I loved joy
Well The Mummy basically bombing does that mean this is the end of their ambitions 	 Probably not Dracula Untold was supposed to be the start of a cinematic universe too before it bombed
And they do this every year 	 Yep it 's a city party for the citizens to enjoy their city and park but everyone is welcome no matter where you 're from Tons of police around so no violence or crime a really safe fun time unless you have too many beers in the beer tent
All of them 	 ALL OF THEM
Jennifer Lopez is his teacher in the movie and Diane Lane is his mother 	 Awesome I 'm going to buy a copy now
I know it 's crazy to think that I got to see this once small little emo band that blew up in the mainstream at such an intimate venue again 	 I 'm incredibly jealous I 'm not a huge fan of them now but their earlier stuff along with The Get Up Kids and Braid were my jams back in the day
I think she is what you expect of an attractive Japanese girl She has a petite build and pleasant features with a soft fair complexion 	 I find Asian girls attractive That coupled with the musical talent is intriguing
I like the actors 	 Who 's in it
Are there any upcoming movies you 're excited about 	 Yes definitely Maybe this is unexpected but I 'm ready to see War for the Planet of the Apes
That was the very first time feedback was used as a part of a recording and performance 	 Yep McCartney A string is feeding to Lennon 's guitar which is what 's causing the feedback
Wow thats amazing i didnt realize they had even been around since the 30s 	 I grew up in Washington Pa only a hour from Pittsburgh so i have grown up loving them
So cell phones end up sending out this tone that drives people crazy and leads them to kill one another 	 Sounds completely ridiculous
I do n't think so maybe years ago but I do n't think he had a recent problem but you never know 	 You are right about that It was such a shock how many lost from drugs such a shame
They will remake anything for the mighty dollar 	 It 's a shame Let 's just hope it 's good
Really 	 Yeah they were nominated and it 's far more original
Oh ya that was such a confusing movie at first 	 Ya I agree it really was
No I think it absolutely holds up There was a remake about a decade ago but the original is better 	 Yes some friends wanted to go see that in the theater but we saw something else Who was in that
North Carolina had turnovers 	 What about field goal shooting
I agree The song called your love is one of my favorites 	 Absoulutely I listen to it every time it comes on the radio
What 's your favorite movie that he 's done 	 I think I 'd have to say Get Hard that one was really funny especially with Will Ferrell
Well are there any classical compositions that you especially like 	 Hmmm I like Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony And Fur Elise
well good for you 	 If it 's not rihanna then who is your favorite artist
Oh okay 	 Do you like her
Eli could be an answer if were talking NFL performance 	 What player from the past do you feel is under appreciated
Yes that and the part with the little girl who kept appearing to the little boy 	 I do n't know if I could handle a gift or curse like being able to see dead people It would drive me nuts
I am in the mood to watch something 	 Me to how about a movie
It 's like a throw back to their original album 	 I did think that was their best
Constellations is another good one 	 Any good tracks for that
Perfect 	 CRZY was the last song she played at the show and she brought a bunch of little kids onstage to dance with her
Right But now more often than not I find myself swaying to the elevator music 	 Rocking
Do you like justin bieber 	 Yea hes okay
You 're correct 	 But it seems like there are more than teams
Well we 've gone from banging sticks together to classical music to electronic music 	 Yes I understand now That 's an easy question to answer
I 've heard there 's some artists that got so sick of their hit songs that they actually REFUSE to play them anymore in concert 	 Yeah I 've heard that story as well
Yes you should see it It 's totally on point if you have kids 	 I saw Trainwreck was n't that one of his too
It is also about Pearl Harbor and the events leading up to it 	 Is there a lot of love story in it
I like that one too 	 Which one is your favorite
Yes they are 	 What songs dp you like from them
I guess the toaster is one of these appliances 	 Yes and there 's also a lamp and a radio and an electric blanket And a vacuum cleaner
That was the best game of all time 	 I have an old PlayStation we can actually play it
Yeah I think so too but its going to be worth the wait 	 Yeah it will be well you let me know if you watch any of those movies
This has to do with that whole off hand thing right 	 Off wing Right so If I were to shoot left down right wing that will be off wing
See that 's where we differ I get bored sometimes with their more traditional stuff 	 I just feel some of their less traditional stuff was akin to them going off the deep end
Yes we probably had the same debate over and over for years 	 Who would you say is the best running back in NFL history
She has good taste 	 Thats what she says
You know I am really into country right now I did n't use to be though 	 Really What made you change
Mostly pop Do you like Christina Aguilera 	 I do n't know much of her stuff I know her song Dirty and Beautiful but that 's about it
I 'm also a big lover of dogs so dog deaths get to me 	 Oh I hated it when Hooch died in Turner Hooch
I know that but thats what his role is 	 I dont know but back to Crosby I think he may never be healthy again
Do you like any country music 	 Some of it is pretty good is there anything new out
How is she in it 	 I think she does a great job but her character is so minor
Have not heard that yet 	 You have to hear it
It 's a form of hip hop that 's more approachable 	 Who are some famous trip hop artists
I think the first matrix is probably Keanu Reeves best movie ever 	 I totally agree with you He is a really cool actor for that role
Yeah the CGI or whatever they used to change his face was really well done 	 Same for the goblins
Well I have always liked prince Eric 	 He was cute with his big blue eye 's and dark hair
Poor thing 	 Hey
Yeah there were some clips on Amazon He still has the golden voice 	 Sounds great Did he work with Steinman again
What ever happened to Bad Boy 	 P Diddy got huge
What is your favorite Bruno Mars Song 	 I really like Treasure It was the best for me
Yeah it 'll be great i ca n't wait to see college kids compete 	 How about Mitch Trubisky
I never cared about the pre-season either until last year when Tony Romo got hurt 	 It was a magical season for the Cowboys last year
the where the worlds best group would you say 	 they made alot of people happy in those days
I think inna heights is my favorite what about you 	 my favorite album is Til Shiloh
Yeah Boston Calling is usually mostly alternative music not metal 	 I just went to one of the food trucks during their set Who played when you went
Really I heard the Cowboys just joined the league then 	 Yep in
Two good old school offensive teams I 'll definitely be there 	 Great and yeah it should be a high scoring beast of a game
Yea many people loved it The reviews were raving especially in the China Box office 	 Are you serious How much did it gross there
Well fish do eat each other sometimes and they die really easily so I told my husband it would be too traumatic 	 Is your son still really sensitive about that
I think Hey Jude is the greatest 	 Why do you think Hey Jude is the greatest
Yeah the predators are really good this year I ca n't believe what they did to the black hawks 	 Wow that was crazy right Who would of thought
They do I was just reading the pop charts 	 What is the top pop song
Very cool I hope that the Cowboys go all the way this year 	 I heard a rumor that Tony Romo is going to retire this year is that true
maybe because of the technology digital instrumentation is so sophisticated now that real instrumentation is pretty rare these days 	 I 've noticed the distinct digital sound now maybe it 's part of a changing social philosophy
i think they probaly had more than albums i could be wrong 	 i have to ask my dad he knows
So Emotional is another good one 	 Really I do n't think I 've ever heard it
During that period they were arguably one of the biggest bands on the planet 	 They had a different sound
Turn it up loud I like it loud 	 You mean like Jewel T and DJ Dollar Bill I like It Loud Remember that joint
I love you too buddy Hey you want to listen to my computer 	 That depends on what you are listening to
its about nazi germany and them taking out nazis 	 that sounds very violent
Have you seen the latest version of Tron 	 That would be Tron Legacy in
That 's the movie It 's about a train that 's been infected by a zombie outbreak The passengers are trying to avoid infection and ca n't get off the train so it 's really suspenseful and scary 	 That 's been on my top list to watch Korean horror movies have really taken a step up in terms of quality I have gotten tired of movies like The Conjuring and those Paranormal Activity movies
Well yeah Siemmeins might not have been on his caliber but just give him a year or two 	 That 's true it can be little hard for a rookie to be good on the spot
Nope No quarterback worth talking about 	 What about Siemien I thought he was good
I like hearing them on the radio 	 But it killed them Their songs used to meander in a beautiful way wondering on a landscape then soaring to another Not anymore Radio dont lie that

I like arias because they are shorter 	 I like the vocals I like concertos when I am trying to read or study
I du n no I have to check let 's see Oh wait there are no more tour dates 	 Hah That sucks
Ca n't argue there 	 I think they 'll win it all this year
Really A lot of people think that is the worst one 	 I like the plot and I like the fact that the effect look better than the older films
Like who 	 Well there 's DJ Okawari who also makes very place-based ambient songs
No I actually look on eBay quite often as well 	 I never even considered using eBay for buying clothes How is the selection
Oh 	 A murder mystery along with a lot of personal mysteries among the people trying to figure it out
Yeah but he plays for the worst football team in the NFL in a very tough division 	 I totally agree that Cleveland is n't a model franchise but Kizer will be stepping into an offense with a decent running game and a good offensive line Give him a chance
If the jokes are good though does it need the profanity 	 I think you can argue that sometimes profanity makes the joke
It 's a playlist of covers by KHS 	 Who 's KHS
Me too want to join me 	 I would love too

Sounds interesting Is Black Veil Brides breaking up 	 No they are just taking a break He wanted to try a different sound
I love fifth harmony 	 Me too what songs
I 'm not saying Bulls would win the series but they 'd at least win ONE game 	 Imagine GSW and Cavs going to the finals both having records
Me too Although my favorite from the series would have to be Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 	 I liked that one too Are the Harry Potter movies your favorite of all time
THANKS THAT SOUND GOOD LOOKING FOWARD TO THAT 	 OK SO IS I BYE THE WAY I WILL CALL A FRIAND ALSO

The Fame 	 Yes
No what is it about 	 Its a movie about all different types of movie that happened
Yea he was he 's such a great actor 	 Yea and he does such weird movies
Was that a Lennon and McCartney song 	 Yes In fact some claim that A Day in the Life was the best Lennon/McCartney collaboration

I just listened to The Beatles on my iPod their music is so great 	 I know classic I do n't think anyone has been able to recreate what they had
How 	 Exactly my reaction
Did you see the new Fast the Furious 	 Yes I did but it 's not the same without Mia and Brian
That 's right I saw it once 	 I want the Zenon ones to be released

Do you remember the Wallflowers 	 Yes I do I like their song One Headlight
There are n't that many Comedies are mostly ignored by the Academy 	 Why
It 's pretty good 	 She 's got to be old is n't she

She is good in the movie 	 I knew she was in it but I 've never seen the film
Something Just Like This by the Chainsmokers 	 Nice I love the Chainsmokers
Whay do got think of the music of today 	 I do n't
yep They have supportive arguments for their guesses and they 're pretty interesting 	 Like what
I watched the oscars I think everyone was stunned he did n't 	 Sly was ready to stand up to get the award I think
Yea Barry Sanders was awesome 	 Yes he was
Do you know their are sequels to the movie 	 I actually did not how are they
They say that the d backs may win this game tonight due to the hitting they have been producing 	 It has been of the hook Did you see the dodger game last night
That 's my point exactly The Bears front office has no idea how to build a roster 	 Well if these high risk drafts do n't pan out then I would expect Gates to be fired as Bears GM after this season
Haha good one 	 What about you
Their schedue is tougher and I think other teams will be more fo them 	 I would n't worry too much They still have the same personnel
Yeah I heard that it seemed forced 	 Yeah But it wasnt terriable I believe that they will be making another one soon At leas the teaser at the end made it seem that way
I ALSO LIKED LITTLE RICHARD 	 HE WAS THE BEST LOOKING MAN IN SHOW BUSINESS
Aside from that what did you like though 	 The music mashups were all really well done

At least I named one that you liked Alright have you seen the Godfather Trilogy 	 No I have n't though I 've heard a lot about them
Okay I will What 's the new cd called 	 it 's called unleashed
First of all before Ringo drummers were measured by the drumming solo Ringo did n't do that 	 He always was just in the background
I also like Work From Home 	 Oh yeah that song is fabulous
I know I saw an actress wearing a fishnet top in People magazine last week 	 Oh no I was hoping that style of top would never make a comeback
That truly was bold but not as bold as the sweat suit Snoop Dogg put on with a gold chain 	 Terrance Howard looks hansome in his Dolce and Gobana suit wearing money green
What do you think is missing 	 I really wished we could improve on the defensive side of the ball a little to be honest with you
Yeah i think the name are sean and bey 	 Im happy for them they got a boy and a girl at the same time what a blessing
And you 're acting a bit pissy too 	 Sorry Sorry
Right But as far as marching bands playing in sporting events like football we do know the first band ever to play at a half time 	 Which is
She said she only took half a pill 	 She ai n't missing no meals
They are like the perfect band from Los Angeles they also just have such a grunge like style 	 Yeah totally but also it 's got that metal element that I so enjoy
Yes and so did Taraji P Henson wearing that Oscar de la renta gown 	 I think that Vivica A. Fox nailed it with that gold and blue Giorgio Armani dress
I know I know I think they made some good draft picks this year Finally 	 Do n't you say that every year Who did they get again
I liked the action a lot more in Guardians of the Galaxy 	 Me too but I liked Ant-Man a lot more
I really hope the Dresden Dolls are still together 	 Who are they
I can never watch one and not the other 	 They 're just such a great movie franchise
Yeah that 's a good one I 'd love to see them in concert 	 Another one I was suprised about is that new song by Harry Styles
That 's great to hear though like you have I had and still have my reservations 	 Original lineups are always preferred but when an original lineup is getting no results why not shuffle around
It was okay It had two singles called Summertime and Single that were both allright 	 I have n't heard them
Me too it always makes sense to me 	 I like it for the acoustic guitar
Depends who is playing Who are the teams 	 I heard it 's the Magic again versus the Warriors

Yes they were 	 Who was the QB for the Bills back then

But Star Wars holds up My daughter and I watched it together recently 	 Oh yeah How did she like it
Not really I guess if you could find a rock station that plays new stuff 	 So they are a newer band
The first one that comes to mind is Penny Lane 	 What makes it feel like it 's a real life description
Uh oh So you 're getting a Twilight overload 	 I already have for years because she has the dvds I ca n't even count how many times I 've watched a Twilight movie over a hundred I 'm sure
Yes I got the digital download What did you think 	 It 's okay I really thought her Bad Romance album was much better
Oh I heard about it but did n't see it 	 Mixed reviews I might pass
I think that is a terrible idea 	 Yes I agree with you man Have you heard of any
So many characters were shown from this movie at theme parks and disney channels and parks 	 Yes that is right
Yes it was not pop enough for her She is a pop star not a country one 	 I like the change of pace of her stuff
Yeah I remember that too My brother had a X-wing fighter He was a huge Jedi fan 	 Did he have one of those that shot stuff
What a silly waste of money 	 No it means a lot to him that his Dad thought to buy him something he would like They are n't close but he wishes they were
Those are some great bands that have all made wonderful music over the years 	 I used to listen to one of these groups before every game of my junior and senior seasons

You have to be very willing to move and adapt if you play or coach 	 I do n't know if I could move my family around that much
you bet I feel the psychology in some of her music beats at the same rate as high school teenagers 	 her later music has become more mature I think she has moved on

Have you seen the Broadway performance of Frozen 	 No Io have n't
Matt Cain is pitching well at home He is also hitting decently 	 Finally Did you hear that Hunter Pence is now injured
I think Olaf may be my favorite Disney character 	 Hmm that 's a tough one I 'm not sure who mine is
Do you think old people are too nostalgic for old hip-hop 	 I get where they 're coming from A lot of the stuff from the past had way more substance than the newer stuff
Yeah better than the Browns 	 Anyone is better than the Browns Man they were bad last season
I do n't believe they did either 	 Watching these games feels like a scrimmage
I really like them 	 Who is your favorite character
Hakuna Matada was my favorite saying 	 What did you think about the the sequels

It 's nothing compared to the aeolus 	 That 's another instrument named after a Greek god
I know what you mean there 	 They should be right at the top again
He spends the whole book complaining and trying to thwart the rules 	 If Dumbledore had explained to him he probably would have understood

Wait that 's the one with the girl in the bed right 	 Yeah she 's possessed by the demon

Yeah actually I do I like it a lot 	 Whose your favorite artist
You did n't like the Hobbit 	 It drug on too long I thought The Hobbit cartoon was better
The only song I liked from that album was Psychosocial 	 I did n't even like that song
Oh right on I like them a lot 	 They were so popular in their time There 's been no other band like them
I wonder if his veganism had any effect on his music 	 I 'm sure subconsciously it did
Yes yes I know I said that but I took my two nephews to see it last week 	 Oh ok Well then that 's out The new Pirates of the Caribbean debuts this weekend
Yeah they always make great choices in voice actors I ca n't wait for the next Disney movie to come out 	 Me too they never disappoint
anakin 	 why
Well that 's true What other reasons do you have 	 I know you said that it 's all about heartbreak over trucks dogd and women but at least that 's real emotion It 's not about trivial things like sneakers or cars
did you used to listen to rock 	 yes when I was a teenager but not now
Yea but I liked the original version a bit more 	 Most originals are way better but his version was still entertaining
No I never have but its my favorite sport 	 I really need to get the basic rules down pact though
Also Lady Gaga she won an emmy 	 I still see her as a musician more than an actress where J lo is both to me

Why 	 I do n't want to have to censor my music when I 'm around the kids I do n't want them to hear cursing and hypersexualized things
Did you see beauty and the beast 	 Yes I loved it
The essential plot is Al Pacino plays a veteran cop who travels for a case over to a small Alaska town to solve a murder case It also the time of year where this town is light 	 Oh so it 's called Insomnia because not only is Al Pacino on a case he ca n't sleep
Man that 's a tough one 	 You have to chose one or the other
aw no tell me he had another chance 	 so ortiz gets to a full count outs bases loaded and CRACK he sends it over center field
Me too I also had all her movies 	 She was great Some of her later music got a little weird
They were always talented they just needed the chance to show it 	 The Beatles discography is an amazing journey in itself really
I just saw men 's watches 	 Really I wonder why
Me too 	 Growing up I always wanted to be Ariel and find my Prince Eric

Well yeah sort of 	 Sort of What 's that supposed to mean Did they leave or not
Which artists are doing that a lot lately 	 For rock Well it seems like I 've heard that from Kings of Leon
They will be good no doubt 	 I ca n't believe they blew the Super Bowl
Nice choice I like them too 	 Next would be Taylor Swift She 's had so many hits
Oh Then what happens 	 Well you get an average score for the each positions

Well it 's fun to watch hockey because there are usually fights 	 I suppose so if you like that sort of thing
In Aladdin do you think Ja'Far hated Aladdin or the Genie more 	 I think Ja'Far hated everyone
Yea you too 	 definitely
Yes That 's such a hilarious scene even though it 's quite brutal too 	 I like when they 're all sitting around the table in the restaurant and Joe Pesci is telling stories
nah that is so subjective 	 well important rap vs pointless rap
Yeah that was cooler than the last battle 	 It was so creepy
Yep John can kill anybody the send and get past anybody they have try to protect the little putz 	 Okay now I defintely want to see this movie
Yeah I guess so 	 A ton of old movies use the same methods
Agreed the youngest is the cutest 	 Agnes is the name of the youngest I believe She is cute
Her concerts are expensive like crazy And for piano recitals the seats to the left of the stage sell out instantly 	 Why the left and not the center with the best acoustics
Is it a political thriller or a romance 	 I think that 's the problem It was trying to be both but failed pretty horribly at both It was a very melodramatic shock value movie
How many games do you think they win this year 	 I 'm guessing but I 'm hoping for many more
Mostly I like the social aspects of the game 	 No argument here You and a lot of people
He has been working in the preseason workouts 	 Well add the best defensive player in the league to the best defense
Hoping to go to the theater with my BF have n't decided what I 'm going to go see though 	 I love movies maybe I can help

Yes 	 He is a good player
Yeah it 's so good 	 But I like all her music honestly
How so 	 They used the beat of the music to guide his feet with walking
What 's your favorite album by them 	 Definitely Dark Holler Pop it 's a good introduction to Bluegrass and grassroots music in general
Of course I do n't want to miss good games 	 Are you still Seahawks fan
Have you listened to much of Michael Jackson 's music 	 Quite a bit Which era are you interested in
Not as many bands do that anymore I like it because the song hangs around a little longer and you do n't have to say goodbye right away 	 Yeah it is kind of like that
i 've been wanting to go to that festival lets try to get tickets and see her live 	 that would be really good but lets buy her album before we see her live though
Yeah that was everywhere at the time I used to have it memorized 	 In the modern day game who 's your favorite running back
I have no idea what Sean Payton is thinking as if he does n't coach the team better this year he 'll be fired 	 I am thinking the same way as he has had plenty of time to get the team to improve
I never really liked silent movies until watching Pleasure Garden 	 I bet you 'll like The Ring too Is that in your collectioin
Gabbert only threw for a measly yards 	 Wow That 's crazy What did Chicago 's QB do
She just gave birth to twins 	 Oh yes I heard about it
My favorite is the song Forgot about Dre Its one of his best songs 	 His collaborations with Dre are always well done
Sure but that does n't mean that players should n't be able to celebrate more in general 	 I do think the celebrations have to be classy and they can still be flashy
Do you wish you could see him today 	 Absolutely it 's a shame he is gone
Who do you like 	 I like the hulk and iron man
Me too 	 That would have been funny
I remember the singer Cyndi Lauper who had that great song called Time after time that was a huge hit 	 Yeah I remember that song it was great
I agree Cobain was great However I do n't think you can beat the rock music from the 's or 's 	 Who is your favorite
I have n't been following those teams too closely but I would actually say that the Dolphins will do the best in 	 Really You do n't think Tampa Bay will have a good year
Did yo ever see the Lion King 	 I think so
So there 's sort of a logical progression There 's the simple music they wrote while they were uh bopping around then they sat still and took the time to be deliberate then they figured out what made studio recording unique then they went ridiculous with it 	 Right it 's all the same creative flow That 's one of the things I find so interesting about the Beatles how transparently you can trace their creative development
I might watch I was thinking of my brother actually 	 He 's a great pitcher He 'd do great
The packers always seem to be the best team 	 Aaron Rodgers is the GOAT
Is it scarier than the last film 	 That 's what all of the early reviews say
Yes it is We 're lucky to get on it more than once per trip 	 They are also making Toy Story land in Walt Disney world too It 's gon na be awesome
I can share some other tracks with you if you 'd like 	 Sure tell me

They were having the annual festival about a week and a half ago and somebody died during it 	 That 's sad What happened

Some new ones are pretty dope 	 Uhhh like who
I think the Cowboys are coming for it 	 They have alot of fresh players and they are good
Definitely has to be Michael Jackson 	 Why do you say Michael Jackson instead of Madonna
yes I like it as well 	 I am really excited about listening to this crystal bowl music
What that was a cover 	 Yeah the original was done by the Isley Brothers like a few decades before ca n't remember exactly

Who was your favorite character 	 Boba Fett
That was a great movie I think Moana has become my favourite though 	 I loved Moana
No way Dom has a kid 	 Yep and he is being held hostage by Sypher along with the mother
Well look at Angel Haze or Cupcakke 	 But Busta Rhymes goes just as hard
Im glad they did n't put all personalities in the movie though It would have been too complicated 	 I agree sometimes it was hard to remember between the names and personalites
Explain yourself 	 Well their is music underground and it might help expand your horizens and help your mood
Maybe he just did n't care for the test much 	 oh so like he just did n't care and did n't even try hard
We will see who will win 	 I guess we will
Yes I found I would think about the movie when trying to go to sleep 	 I would get scared that my husband would start screaming in the kitchen or something
Yes it is 	 I love watching it
What is the best rock song ever recorded 	 Stairway to Heaven
I agree 	 I know they needed something slow between the big action pieces but it just felt unnecessary
GOOD well i will see you later 	 yes thank you for the reccomendation
I think we can limit this further Would you choose Alternative over Reggae 	 Yes because it encompasses more of the music I like There is Alternative Rock Alternative Dance Alternative Hip Hop etc.
Do you count Guardians of the Galaxy as a superhero movie 	 Of course absolutely
Do you like pop music 	 Yes i love it its so upbeat
Maybe I will or Home Box 	 I will have to look my husband did n't see it yet
Nothing really 	 Same

That 's pretty huge though is n't it He was a country music superstar and he got to star in a classic western film with John Wayne 	 Yeah it does n't get any better than that
He is good How about your favorite deceased actor 	 Steve McQueen
I think the sparkling silver one she wore for most of the dancing 	 I loved the headpiece on that outfit

Well James Hetfield microphone was n't on 	 No way What happened
What CD are you putting on 	 Warren Zevon Greatest hits
Right I 'll give him months and check back 	 That team has had changes lately
Pretty good pretty good 	 I 'm ready for the season to start It 's been too long
Hey man what do you think of all these new rappers 	 I do n't know man I 'm a fan of I guess classic rap
I do not know how they could compose that music like that It is amazing 	 Yes Sebastian Bach was actually a church organist for most of his life
I think they 've got some good players but I 'm not so sure about the new coach 	 What 's up with the new coach
I thought the quarterback was the leader 	 They 're both leaders The coach is just a more off screen leader
Is there anything he ca n't do 	 He is pretty talented
its okay 	 its a big hit though
That 's a pretty big deal Do n't they already have some goalies 	 They do have Cam Ward and Eddie Lack already
Kind of like Weird Al 	 Yeah kind of but not really
Yeah It strikes me that this a older wiser Luke 	 Probably a Luke who is done with fighting overall and lacks some purpose
Really Were n't they the worst team just a few years ago 	 Yeah But that 's when they were in the National League
Well then you need about million cases of beer on Super Bowl weekend which is a tab of more than billion to wash all that chicken down 	 Ahhh beer and chicken wings
Yes that 's it I love that song That song puts me in a good mood 	 Me too It feels like summer to me
It 's interesting to learn where hip-hop samples come from 	 Yeah I 've always enjoyed tracking that stuff down
Why 	 The first of the season games start tonight
He is a great actor 	 I completely agree
You have no idea 	 What do you mean
It 's absolutely hilarious Plus the sound track is great and will totally get stuck in your head 	 I had heard that
I agree Kiss the girl and Under the Sea is some of the best composed music ever 	 I agree I feel like the lack of music in Brave really sets it apart from The Little Mermaid
What is your favorite album of his 	 Probably Nebraska
The one you bought in San Francisco 	 Exactly It was pretty see-through
And he loves that car 	 And everyone loves that car It 's a Boss Mustang cubic inches of American steel That 's a dream car for just about any red blooded American That IS an American car
The relatuonship between Anna and her little brother is sweet too 	 I know It was so nice when Anna found out how much he really loves her
Well more than ever it 's poppy and taking more and more notes from each other to the point I almost ca n't differentiate between some songs 	 Yeah I know what you mean But hip hop has been keeping it real There 's some good pop too
Yeah it 's different then her old stuff 	 Yeah it 's so soulful I really like it
Kevin Hart is a good actor Let 's get a comedy so we can laugh 	 Ok I 'll rent Central Intelligence tonight then
Daily life was great but Closer was amazing I still listen to that song 	 Yea it 's too bad cartoons in American do n't take music as seriously as in Japan
Obewan Kenobi 	 Really He did n't do much
I think so I like Adam West in general but his Batman was just 	 Know-it-all dingbat
she has this uplifting spirit when she raps 	 all rappers have that kind of spirit
No I did n't know they were playing last night 	 Yeah the Shiners killed the Warriors
If you had to pick a couple which would they be 	 Well I really like rap and country
Wow I 'd pretty much given up on Manyard ever doing anything with Tool again 	 I know when he started yet another side band I figured Tool was done
I think they take a step back though this year 	 With that defense and receiving corps No way
I hear some of it from my granddaughter F-bombs throughout 	 I do n't know what the point is
Do n't know 	 I have n't heard about them in a while
Pretty good because I liked that it had real people along with the animation 	 Big Emma Watson fan are you
I agree Lots of her songs are about the struggle of well being human 	 I agree One of my favorite song from her is I am in here
Who was your favorite artist from the Voice so far 	 Well having said that about vocalists my favorite so far is Laith al-Saddig
its not old it is classic 	 what do you like about his songs
Thats so true i think everyone has watched it 	 well whats better than a sponge driving a krabby patty
I wounder what they will do with Carrie Fishers part 	 They will probably digitally alter the scenes
No but there are some old ones I can 	 Like what
Or John Elway with the Broncos 	 And today we 're stuck with guys like Colin Kaepernick and Tom Brady
Oh I 'm listening to Public Enemy 's discography again 	 How long does that take
Yea I understand he was great but Sanders could not hardly even be tackled 	 While we are talking about great running backs I have to throw in Walter Payton 's name
Sure that would be nice 	 Well i got one it is about someone entering dreams and such
Indeed it does I like that you get to see what finally happens to Luke Han and Leia after so many years I always wondered 	 There is also a good mix of old and new characters that keeps the story exciting
Oh yeah I remember when he came out with Crossroads Great tunes man 	 No.no that was later he did that single After Midnight now that was a great song
Well then i guess i would peg that one as my favorite of his movies 	 Do you know their are sequels to the movie
Better than the first one 	 I would n't go that far but pretty close
Me neither 	 We should go watch it
He really is I think he and Brad Paisley are two of the best guitarists in country music right now 	 Yeah I agree Vince Gill is also great
I 'll have to give it a listen I liked their older stuff 	 Yeah Mykynos is a great song
I do like Billy Crudup Okay I 'm interested Any other good cast members 	 Well I 'm not a huge fan but Michael Fassbender is really good in the movie playing David and Walter these android characters He 's really good and it 's interesting fare
Yes it is a revolutionary album 	 Ok thanks for sharing
Sure has Especially after that earlier afternoon games with the twins losing 	 That game was brutal to watch
I agree he was pretty good as well 	 Oh and do n't forget Snoop Dog
Scarey does not have to always be dark but dark is just dark even if it is never scarey 	 The oompha loomphas were also better in the original
I 'm so excited about the Stanley Cup playoffs 	 Me too I think the Penguins will win this year
Yeah i 'm not sure i think the cartoon it 's pretty special already 	 I know what you mean but hey you may be surprised i 'm guessing they will do something just great
Not really 	 Yes really several of them do
People might not realize it if they only buy his albums because they 're hip and cool 	 Yes Bowie is a case where a compelling image is just the surface
But in Tangled she was not raised by her parents just the evil witch lady 	 But they were still alive and she met them later
Maybe LeBron is still playing like he 's in his 20s though 	 Yeah he 's really on a mission to win it again this year
I like a lot of different types of films actually A good suspense movie or a romantic comedy always gets my attention 	 I am the same way I like a movie that really makes you think
What is the first one 	 The first one I chose was Fighter
Claustrophobia 	 Yeah for some people
Yeah very 	 I agree
Yea he 's up there 	 I guess he 's pretty good I 'm just not a Panther 's fan
I thought it was very different than her previous work 	 Well that 's pretty vague Was it different in a good way or a bad way
Do you like rap music 	 It depends
Kind of it only had a budget of a few million Like or million or something like that 	 Well that explains why I 've never heard of it then
What 's that got to do with movies 	 There 's a really good movie about it called Judgement at Nuremberg I think it was ade in like or something Our service men and women ought to see that movie in boot camp That way they will know better than to follow orders like that
I know but I love it due to the passion she sings it with 	 You are right she is a very emotional performer
Well it is told from the perspective of the evil fairy 	 Oh and she is named Maleficent
So I watched the Force Awakens I am lost 	 By what Good film
What did you imagine 	 I do n't know Some pompous arrogant pop star who was self-centered and ignorant
So you think they will mention we have been working with good aliens 	 Who knows but can you really say we have n't
Yes it is really well done great actors great plot 	 What is it about
what other songs on on his album I need to download some 	 no good and all the pretty girls are also really good songs
Weird to think it was one of their last ones 	 Such a shame After Lennon died it just went downhill
If it was that simple everyone would be rappers making millions of dollars 	 Who are some of your favorite rappers
I heard Donald Glover is in the movie playing a young Lando Calrissian 	 That should be good Woody Harrelson is in it too
I 'm sure she did A lot of her songs are about her relationships 	 That 's what I love about her music
Did you catch the Chargers game last night 	 No I had to work Who did they play
I know oh geez Royals are now behind Only outs left to go ahead Yeah I feel real good about this I knew I should n't have turned it on 	 These last seasons have just been soul crushing Guess we 're back to the team we 've had for the last years a losing one Ugh
That 's right and GB went on to beat the Colts 	 Yeah Baltimore Colts back then
I also like how they can be good guys but still act bad 	 yeah the good guy bad guy aspect makes it way better than most movies like it
Yeah I definitely will 	 Remember singing Jessie 's Girl when we were in high school
Comedy mostly 	 I love all horror movies
That is a nice premice 	 Yes and he encounters some drama to say the least
Right because Ice Cube 's son O'shea Jackson played him right 	 Yes He looks more like Ice Cube than Ice Cube does
I hate cartoons period Waste of money 	 Some are funny did you see Sausage Party
Give me an example of one 	 Well this is an old one
Not bad Are you excited for the sequel 	 Absolutely I saw the preview and it was hysterical
What 's different about it 	 Without giving too much away again there 's more going on than just a love story
Rambo was the first one 	 Great movie Sort of felt bad for him in that
No because none of the original cast was present 	 I think one or two were in it
This song is called Living Hope 	 That 's great Does the album have any other songs that stand out
Well there is a reason it exists people have types 	 I disagree a little I think everyone is so multifaceted If given the chance
What did they do 	 They were one of those almost teams that constantly dominated their division had a great defense terrorized everyone but always managed to lose in the playoffs In fact they never made it to the Super Bowl until XIV when they lost to that great Steelers team
Everyone was dwarfed next to Peter Mayhew 	 The scenes between her and Darth Vader black vs white good vs evil tall vs tiny were very dramatic
Yes it does n't quite look NFL-level but I know they are constructing a new state-of-the-art stadium 	 It will probably be crazy how modern it is
Do you think they 'll repeat their season 	 Well it 's kind of early to tell but they look good
Yes I think that was her coming out stage of little girl music etc. 	 People expected her to be a certain way all the time
For sure it is But the music is the foundation 	 I ca n't disagree And Freddie Mercury 's music was wonderful
True I do catch myself singing along to Bad Blood sometimes 	 It 's hard not to The chorus to that song is awesome
Are you a big Schwarzenegger fan 	 Yes he is a great action hero

Ever heard of Weather Report 	 Of course Morning clouds will make way for clear skies and temperatures into the mid-70s with lows into the 60s overnight
True It 's possible that they completely missed the point I would n't put that past them But that 's why we have death of the author 	 I bet the next movie completely fails to confirm your idea

It is a great movie I am so glad Disney owns Marvel 	 Me too I loved the jokes in this one

Which teams 	 Schools I attended or taught at If a student is projected to go high in the draft or at all from a small school I pay attention
I wonder if they will have to change the plot around to reflect Kylo Ren 's parents both being dead 	 A lot of the characters do n't seem to have parents though Leia Luke Anakin Ray all were missing parents
I think it was in 	 Wow They been out for years now
I never noticed this stuff 	 Once you start watching it 's everywhere The boy has stickers on his door and in the middle of the scene a sticker vanishes But it 's symbolic
And the position foquarterback is differnt on each team While each quarterbacks call plays hike hand off and throw the ball each team has their own style of play that makes the QB position different on that team 	 So it 's a tough task I get it
I heard him in Tanglewood too in the summer of 	 I wish I were there

Aftermath 	 I really like to watch war movies
Remember the Immaculate Collection 	 Of course And they would have Madonnathons on MTv
And offensive too They made him so annoying 	 I believe many were upset that they made him try and sound Jamaican

It is so calming and yet so epic at the same time 	 Every time I hear it it reminds me of the movie

Wow that 's a special list 	 Yes those are some of the greatest teams ever
But Brady has been having some great seasons He is ready for retirement 	 True but personally I 'd rather quit while I 'm ahead than stay in the game and go out with a loosing season

No Its authentic C.J. Prosise signed this last year 	 Wow That might be worth alot in a few years
He has had a few darker roles like this but few and far between I liked that Christopher Nolan did n't type cast him or not cast him at all 	 Christopher Nolan is such a wise man he makes such smart choices for his films

There are Bela Bartok and Stomits are especially famous 	 Well I guess I will have to look into that more
EDM 	 Like electronica I wanted things to be big and loud
It was definitely Stallone 's call 	 He really didnt do anything else

I left wanting to go back and watch it again 	 Well I know I will need to go see it then
Winona Ryder acted like a spoiled brat 	 Was n't that the idea

I love them the MCU is one of the best things to happen to movies lately 	 What about DC
Michael Cera is a good actor 	 He kinda feels out of place though

The Seahawks 	 Are you serious right now

Now that was a great movie Extremely creepy Loved Jack Nicholson 's performance 	 At least I named one that you liked Alright have you seen the Godfather Trilogy
I think they 're going to win at least games Ryan Tannehill looked good last season and he 's only going to get better 	 I like Tannehill and I think the Dolphins wide receivers have a lot of speed but they 're not the best receivers in the game
Well just go and see it and you will not be disappointed at least take the kids 	 Hmm ok but first I will have to watch the first part

What do you think is the hardest position 	 I think quarter back
He 's so fast Just get him the ball in the flat and let him work his magic 	 On the lighter side the Cowboys drafted a guy named Taco
Yes because the level of disrespect they showed was not just to the flag but to every military person every citizen in our great nation And they make millions with no retribution for their disrespect 	 So would n't they be showing their freedom of speech though
Yeah I really like everything on DS2 by Future 	 Alright thanks man i 'll give it a listen tonight
It was the scene where they were at the shield generator door 	 Oh yeah but Han took care of him later
That 's tough because if you have good season it 's probably still not as good as the Patriots 	 Well now Arizona 's division has gotten tougher with the emergence of Seattle
Yes navy is such a good rich classic color It was great color for her too 	 I would not normally say a bird print would be a good idea but I loved Zendaya in Dolce Gabbana 's off the shoulder full trained dress was gorgeous
Of course I 've never been to a concert before 	 Was the singer good

No way Desmond Bryant played for the Crimson 	 yep And let 's see whoelse Oh Yeah Kyle Juszczyk
So out of the rest then which one 	 I would probably have to say The Half-Blood Prince
I think she writes a lot for others as well 	 She may have started country and went on to pop but she is really a singer song writer
That was a good one too 	 They are all good really
Yeah they 've won with multiple coaches and quarterbacks 	 Exactly I think their ownership structure really knows how to run a winner

They 're not all wussies That guy that died getting the goblet was amazing 	 He 's the rare exception Most Hufflepuff are wussies
It was based on a book I saw it a few years ago and loved it 	 I 'm looking forward to watching the new Beauty and the Beast move with Emma Roberts
Haha Yeah I like Cole though I just hope he stays healthy 	 Definitely a lot of promise for Cole and all things considered I do n't see a reason why he ca n't take this opportunity and run with it
On top of creating them they have to render the amount of computer power required to render that much cgi is mind boggling 	 Right I wonder how many server farms it took to render all of that movie

It starred Alec Baldwin who played the baby 	 Wow I 'm surprised Usually his movies are great
I usually watch them at the house You 	 I like to go out for the games Either to a bar or to one of my friends places
Ha ha that must have looked funny I remember some of the fans used to heckle the players Did n't like that too much as it seemed pretty rude 	 They had a couple funny mascots that ran around for the entire game They pulled all kinds of pranks and entertained the crowd
Yea and it was lead by steven speilberg so you know it was good 	 So many good movies were directed by him

That would be great Her voice really is amazing 	 She did a live performance of Gaga 's Till It Happens To You that will blow you away
I do n't know maybe but against Seattle or Arizona they would have been beaten with and outs and then just ground to paste by those offenses 	 I 'm not saying they were unbeatable but if the pass threat had been there you would have only heard Kelly 's praises sung
I am going to look for this movie 	 You should I think you will enjoy it
Kendall always brings her A game Those crystals were to die for 	 I was speechless when I saw her Her shoes matched perfectly Definitely a show stopper

He does have a unique delivery 	 I think When Disaster Strikes is a hallmark rap album

I can only afford one jersey at a time 	 Then you 're not that great of a fan
I 'm a little iffy on Mandy Moore too I know she released a lot of album and she probably is the most successful one career wise and still going today 	 Mandy Moore played it safe by the books I think she has a very devoted group of fans She never really played up some kind of image like the other singers and her music was very mellow in comparison

They did introduce them in the force awakens 	 Yeah but they are still holding onto the original cast

Yeah exactly like that but add on the fact the melody is bad too 	 That does sound bad but to get the full effect I 'll have to give it a listen
It is It is because these guys are good at what they do 	 What is a good place to start if I want to get into them
They did a good job making you realize how bad things got for the main character 	 They did n't use the name Ben-Hur much

I agree Sometimes age can catch up quick but I do not know about this one 	 Yea they just build a team around Brady year after year
To each his own I like it either way 	 Yeah I like the dog van
I think Boston will take it now They looked impressive out there tonight and I do n't see them losing at TD Garden 	 I think so too it will go though for sure
I 'd have to say Pocahontas 	 Really out of all the movies Why
Except for the fact that the Raiders now have Marshawn Lynch too 	 Oh that 's right

I thought it was great as a kid but I watched it recently and not so much 	 I did too Esmeralda was my secret crush

Ocean eyes is the best album ever In my opinion anyways 	 Okay Ocean Eyes it is
Yes that is accurate 	 I hate how everything has to be mainstream to be a hit
What is your favorite genre then 	 I love sci-fi fantasy best
Honest.y I 'd never thought of it like that 	 Did you just value the aesthetics of it
I ca n't believe you did n't like it Did n't you think it was frightening 	 You know I liked the story and I liked the characters but I did n't think it was scary
Operation Mindcrime is one of the best if not the best metal albums of all time 	 Wow that 's pretty impressive What else

That Bryce Harper extension was a shocker 	 In what way

who is in it 	 Anthony quinn
Yeah Rosemary 's Baby might be the best horror movie of all time 	 It is definitely up there with The Exorcist and The Shining
AN older one that is great is I Got Some Help I Do n't Need 	 I dont think I have ever heard that one
Yeah what makes it worse is that half the teams make the playoffs in the NHL and they still have n't gotten the Stanley Cup 	 Yeah I hear you but if it 's any consolation I think the Stanley Cup playoffs is one of the most unpredictable in sports The number one seed rarely wins the cup
How did Ryan Gosling do 	 Charming as always Hey girl he really could play the piano

I absolutely agree That is actually one of my favorite scary movies 	 It 's a very simple and yet interesting story following Michael 's character
They have one major sticking point though 	 What 's that
Oh she was stunning in that one 	 Ca n't agree more
I think they will but they need a bridge 	 For what purpose
Do you think they did 	 It 's really close to be honest I could n't say no for sure
I agree 	 We should watch pulp fiction though
It was good Zac Efron and The Rock had good chemistry together 	 Ha I never would have guessed you 'd see those two together in a movie
Yes I would like that 	 I have it on eight-track
Great actor 	 Nicole Scherzinger is Sina

How about The Town It 's one last job and a romance 	 Oh yeah Ben Affleck he was totally believeable
It 's so hard to choose but I like defense so I think I 'd say J. J. Watt 	 Oh yeah he 's really good and people thought he was a bad pick when he got drafted
This is too confusing I think QBR from ESPN is much better 	 But you do n't even know how they calculate it You just like it because it 's from ESPN They 've never made the details public until they do i trust the passer rating from NFL
Yeah he 's really caught in the middle here He set up the impersonation to give his dad a happy last moment but then what does he do 	 Anyway so what about this Durbin woman
heart wants what it wants 	 oh yeah that one makes me cry
I think they need to develop and protagonist and antagonist 	 And thats what she offers at the time
yeah that is considered a thriller 	 yeah it isnt a straight up horror
He was great in them I also liked Tobey McGuire 	 The Spider Man movies were n't the same after Tobey left

They 're the ones that did that song Reflektor right 	 Yeah that was on their newest album I prefer their old stuff though

I guess I can see that but it was n't good 	 I disagree if you look at it from the spoof angle
Are you a fan of either team 	 No my team did n't even make the playoffs
Wow And is that just the box office and not all the toys and other products added in there 	 Exactly digital sales dvd sales and rentals and VHS sales equalled almost billiion dollars
What do you think of Britney Spears 	 I was a big fan of her back then but it seems she is still doing very well these days
Yeah it was very similar 	 Do you recommend it
What you mean bro 	 Well they traded richards and are literally shooting themselves in the foot i do not get why
I like it There were some funny jokes and it had a great message 	 It looks like the visual colors and animation of it are very appealing
Which songs would I know that are on that album 	 Have you heard Something In The Water or Dirty Laundry
I do n't know but they let Colin Kaepernick go so it does n't look good 	 Ca n't see any Super Bowl contenders coming from either division

Trey Anastasio right 	 Yes he played those big shows in Chicago
I know it is easy to forget considering all the pop success she has had 	 Right I mean I ca n't name one country song she did

In they were in the NFC Central 	 Now they are in the NFC north
She is a good singer 	 I agree I chose that song because I feel like it will motivate me
What about Sid Vicious and Johnny Rotten with their antics 	 They were just musicians Most of the punks were just hard working stiffs like you and me
i do n't know about you but I can spend mil 	 Buying things you need not just to buy stuff You need a house not a mansion you need a vehicle not some rocket and you need food and company
I am glad they made aux cords to listen to music in our vehicles and other stereos 	 Yes it makes it so easy I do not listen to CD 's anymore
Yeah 	 Just nervous ill mess up
Well I researched it online and it looks to be mostly political 	 You should make your own judgement though
You 'll never guess what I watched with the kids last night 	 What
We have Soze who pulled all of this off because he wanted to kill/quiet a dude who could identify him and he failed because at the end of the movie a dude did identify him and the NYPD even had a mugshot of him 	 I had this exact question in my head I 'm pretty sure it 's just a plot hole An explanation could be that considering pretty much everything he tells us is a lie maybe even his motivation for the hit job was a lie
Yeah last week.why 	 Have you noticed all the ads that the stadium has
Who 's your favorite female singer 	 Bjork
They know how to write good music 	 Do they still perform

Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the greatest living actors ever 	 I would even argue for all time.He is really up there for me I think many more oscars are in his future or at least performances worthy of an oscar
Me neither 	 We should go together
Either Toy Story or Finding Nemo 	 I like Finding Nemo too
Sort of but I thought it was a little strange 	 In what manner
And then it fell off on the 2nd one 	 Well with the success you always do a sequel
People will eventually be that stupid 	 You are probably right
Sounds typical what happens 	 They are studying it and piss it off Then it kills them all
What is your favorite Meg Ryan movie 	 Hands down Sleepless In Seattle
What 's on it so far 	 Lots of things It 's a pretty busy playlist I want to make sure it can appeal to everyone
So many of them I did n't like any of the Kardashian 's though 	 I agree I was n't a huge fan
I do too The color adds something 	 As does Cary Grant
I agree but I think Kindergarten Cop is one of my all time favorite films 	 Have you seen the sequel with Dolph Lundgren
Maybe they should make a ultimate edition where they fix all the little things that George messed up by messing with the films too much 	 True it could also be a good opportunity to remaster some of the effects and other scenes with mistakes as long as they do n't fundamentally change the content
What songs do they use 	 They use plenty They use music from Hall Oates The Temper Trap etc
For what team 	 The San Francisco 49ers of course
what do you mean by that 	 well it 's a dress made entirely out of meat a lot of animals were killed for that
What about Aaron Rodgers 	 He is about three hundred behind I think missing those years sitting behind Favre is going to cost him a chance

I tihnk the Warriors are overrated They 'll cave to the Cavs again 	 Well at least we do n't have to worry about Washington playing them They wo n't make it that far this year
Maybe we should n't see it then We 'll settle for whatever movie we do n't have to dress up for 	 What movie should we see for your birthday next week
There was that theory at the VMAs that she was singing live at the end which is why she switched to a hand held mic 	 I remember that she grabbed the mic but it seemed like it was turned off She did n't look very happy
I thought it was amazing I loved that they did not go for a happy ending 	 Ya the film especially towards the end had such high stakes

I mean if the music makes sense I am 	 Did you know Clint Eastwood directed one

Whoah I would n't have seen that coming So their music has spanned several decades 	 Yeah hard to believe is n't it
that can be true for a guy who listen to soft tune from mariah carey.lol 	 well how many rap song do you have on your playlist
Yep They 've had a lot of success there and they always expect maximum effort 	 Not to mention there 's always racists in the crowd there
It is pretty amazing they liked him at all 	 The snake is the same as the one from Robin Hood
Yea the slow motion scenes were epic 	 Lawrence Fishbourne was probably my favorite part
That Cincinnati team seems infamous for having players who get in trouble 	 Like who else
Well it bores me 	 That does not make it bad
Do you like rap or hip hop 	 I used to but this new stuff sucks
They did n't want to play him much at first 	 Why would n't they do that

Yeah it might be worth a watch but I never got around to it 	 How about Passengers We saw that the other week

I know They were also hilarious in Baby Mama together 	 Oh yeah that was a good one too
You should check Beatles out They are really cool 	 I hope they are still giving concerts
Agreed I liked Grown Ups and Grown Ups though I thought the second was better 	 Yes it was good but the first was my favorite

That sounds like a live version Is it 	 Yeah Sounds good too do n't it
Hey I saw an old rerun of the Dick Caat show on YouTube 	 Yeah Who was he interviewing
Well it seems like they are trying to be modern instead of sticking to the script For example making Louis a single mom 	 Yes that 's ridiculous and not necessary for the story
How was it 	 It was inspirational I was moved
What That 's a serious question 	 Of course the answer is Jordan It 's not even close
Well in this album and his others He calls out the problem and he asks his people to fix the problem 	 Do you think people will actually fix their problems
Yeah but it is also awe-inspiring the effect he created in the music world I mean I know he was only a portion of the band but as the lead singer he obviousky becomes the main i 	 Yeah one of those once-in-a-generation types
The one that 's all about Han Solo 	 That scoundrel Cool
I 'd say he 's a musician more than anything and has played with all the big names like the Stones and Eric Clapton 	 Oh nice I am just getting introduced tonight to him but I love what I heard
Yeah yeah I hear that 	 So anyway you know I have not watched football too much lately
Because my Cowboys look like they 're ready to make a legitimate Superbowl run this year 	 You sure last year was n't a fluke
The NFL needed this system years ago it 's a plus but can be improved 	 How can they improve the redflag system without adding to much time to the game
No but I bet Jennifer Lawrence is in it 	 You nailed it
I 'll have a team of well educated and anal historians working on it 	 For that you need money
Oh nice Lots of good ones What did you see 	 Most recently I saw Passengers
No way That was cool 	 Yeah his family was all kickers like in football and soccer
Exactly he has been lighting up the league imagine if he had a good defense 	 Yep I think they would have won a few more Superbowls

I do n't care 	 She has friend
You would enjoy this it is a great movie 	 It has a great story
I really like Leaonard Fournette for Jacksonville tons of touches 	 How about Devonta Freeman for Atlanta I think he gets at least touchdowns and yards

I think Set Your Goals was the only other band in that category 	 Yeah I would say A Day to Remember was a bit similar
They start their tour in August We should go check them out 	 For sure Just let me know the dates
I hear you That might be just what I 'm in the mood for though Sometimes I just want a movie that will let me turn my brain off 	 The Wedding Planner definitely requires minimal brain power
Did you see that war movie Fury 	 Yes it was great
Yea it looks really epic and tense Nolan usually does n't disappoint 	 I agree I would definitely want to see it
I got ta run though 	 Good talk man
I know It seems so ridiculous now 	 When I flip through the channels and see one of those old ones on I just laugh at the thought of ever being scared of one of those films
I do want too 	 What do you wan na say
Their songs are so catchy 	 I really liked all of their songs
If you like fast songs I would recommend Dani California 	 I 've heard of the title but never heard the song I 'll check it out
I have n't seen that movie but I feel like I 've heard a lot about it 	 It was pretty groundbreaking when it came out in terms of set design
Well Whitney had quite the voice 	 Yeah she said she sounded just like the album
Oh wow I know I have seen a lot of Disney movies but not sure if I have seen every one 	 Ya I try to make sure I see every Disney movie at the theater if possible
Hard to say how Marcus will do he had a leg injury at the end of last season 	 Most quarterbacks in the NFL recover from leg injuries I think
They are all good really 	 Thats true
Who is that 	 Von Miller
It was pretty good There was lots of thrilling moments 	 Ooh I like a good thriller A movie that keeps you guessing is always a must see
Did you 	 Yeah I liked the Vikings purple and yellow outfits and went with them
I know one of their songs Creation of the Sun 	 Oh yes that 's one of my favorite songs by them
Do you like Ludocris music 	 Yep-My favorite cd was Rappers Delight

I been watching this good thriller movie its interesting 	 What is it called
Here we go What do you think 	 I guess I 'll come to the party

Is it worth being on the list 	 It is very funny and kind of heart warming
I brought them up because I heard that they are going on tour again soon 	 Even after Glen Frey 's death Who 'd they get to replace him as if anybody ever could
That is great 's band They did a ton of great songs 	 I know I love them too They are so 's
He has another year left on his contract too 	 He needs to realize that he can make some serious money if he gets his act together
That 's right It 's a coming of age and revenge story for him 	 But the ending was a little less bleak right
That would be Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law 	 I think the first one sounds best let 's go see the Guardians
Would you be open to seeing Wonder Woman 	 Sure That sounds like it would be a good movie
Jeff Fisher 's superbowl was the good team -LRB- s -RRB- in the NFC West 	 I wonder how Browns fans immediately reacted after that fake fumble in the Skins game
He did a couple of songs on the show so i looked him up and found out he was in a group 	 Very cool How long has he been singing
Honestly I find that one super annoying 	 But the beat is so good
I feel the same she 's such a great singer and she creates those music with her souls 	 I think that 's the magic that makes her songs attactive is n't it
Oh right That 's the one with Wayne the Rock Johnson 	 It was okay but Cinderella is still the best
Have you seen Rogue One 	 Yes The ending was so sad
And I loved the lighter moments like the sequence when Robin and Little John recruit Friar Tuck into their band of merry men 	 Eugene Pallette played Friar Tuck and he was an unexpected and wonderful swordsman in his own right
I do too It also has Alicia Silverstone in it too 	 You 're right I loved that movie as a kid
Too bad Don Shula does n't coach them anymore 	 Yea maybe they 'd win
I like country the best though 	 Country is good
This last one was still pretty good 	 It was okay I missed Paul walker
Ok and 	 Remember he 's been on a year hiatus
Do you want to watch the game with me 	 laughs Not really The only thing that interests me are the uniforms Who the heck is playing
I hated her 	 Samuel Jackson is pretty great in those films too
Hi 	 Do you like Lady Gaga
And So happens that 's where the chapter picks up Wick heads on over to pick up his car and kills a bunch of people 	 Why did he leave the boss alive that 's so stupid that you would want to make a deal with a Russian mob
Sure 	 I watched one on netflix
Yes With all the confusion hubris and craziness it involves 	 Really And she does make it real the power trips the crazy partying and the loneliness and the weird way to interact with people that it all generates
Very I did not know what to expect at all 	 Who is your favorite character
The team had such a long list of talented players like Freddie Solomon Steve Young Deion Sanders and so many more 	 I think they had players inducted into the Pro-Football Hall of Fame
They did an okay job on Trout 	 Yeah I think he only had two singles so he did n't do too much damage
Yea what 's your favorite team 	 The Patriots
I like Yoda and Leia 's theme overall The Empire Strikes Back music is the best 	 Some people like the prequel music too like Dual of the Fates from The Phantom Menace
One of my favorites is Born this way because of the meaning of the song What is your favorite song 	 My favorite is Million Reasons I just like the song for so many reasons I always have it on repeat
Heavy Metal and Country do n't you think that 's a bit strange 	 What do you mean
Yeah kind of my generation 	 My favorite is Nirvana
me too i love the sound it stands alone in a band 	 So what kind of guitar did you get from SAM ash
And he can not even use his unaltered voice 	 I know even those who use autotune can do it
That 's ridiculous the Ewoks were cute and so cool They helped the rebellion fight during that whole battle of Endor 	 Oh I 'm not disagreeing just mentioning what most people think of the ranking of the series I loved the Ewoks too We need to see them return in future Star Wars
Sure Reba Kelly Clarkson Shania Twain 	 How about Miranda Lambert or Jo Dee Messina
They 're okay 	 I mean
It also stars Elle Fanning and Sienna Miller makes a short appearance 	 I love both of those actresses I think Sienna Miller is really good She was terrific in Factory Girl Do they play Ben 's love interest in Live By Night
I think they did it just to entertain the crowd 	 And were you entertained
Who else is in the movie besides Zoey 	 I recognize Halston Sage as she has a pretty big role in this movie She 's been in a handful of movies too but more as a supporting character She 's usually the girlfriend character or friend of the main character Pretty girl and has great screen presence
That was just Kanye West 	 Even the new Kendrick Lamar has some singing on it
Really I 'm going to go see it in a few hours I 'll see for myself 	 Cool Keep your expectations low and you wo n't be disappointed
I understand that 	 Thanks
You absolutely must I will even grab a ticket for you if they play nearby 	 Thanks a lot man I really appreciate it

I 've seen it at least four times and the bar scene still gets my heart racing 	 My second favorite Tarantino movie is Jackie Brown
How do you feel about the original special effects compared to the newer digital special effects 	 I prefer a mix of both I sometimes feel that there is too much of a reliance on digital effects in general anymore
Yeah everyone wants to race to anoint the next great one 	 Yup its become a real problem If I had a vote it would go to Lebron for sure
What was the best lightsaber battle of the whole Star Wars franchise 	 As much as I disliked Phantom Menace I loved the battle where Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan face off against Darth Maul
Hello 	 Hi

You talking bout Whitney BOTH of them are gone 	 Yeah I forgot that George Michael passed as well
That is quite impressive 	 Yea though I feel like most of his movies are great
Then the Bumgarner thing 	 Yeah what was he doing somersaults on a dirt bike
Yep Total luck though 	 Remember Belinelli 's shot
You can start off with Ratatat 	 I think I 've heard of them there is a song with a tiger roar
I agree 	 I think I will watch The Thing tonight
I know I loved him in Good Will Hunting 	 That was a great movie It really made you think about letting go of people you love and how you want to live your life
I 'm sure it was n't 	 Also it was pretty cool to see them smash all their equipment at the end of the show
The song is on the Immortalized album 	 I will have to look that up
They have some tough games 	 What are the tough ones
Who produced that album 	 Madonna and William Orbit produced it
I love those actors 	 So do I. All the movies they play in are good
And the dialogue was so clever They made you believe a man could actually be a virgin at 	 Those guys when they get together make some really funny movies Do you like Adam Sandler

Have you seen the new beauty and beast movie 	 No not yet Is it like the original
Well he did a TV movie called Duel a long time ago with Dennis Weaver It was one of his first films 	 Is that the one about the guy being chased by the evil truck
I do n't know a few years 	 That 's seems about right
we are in a pitching era right now 	 And that will end eventually because everything is cyclical
And who are you going to choose Old school comedy or more recent 	 I am going with old school Mel Brooks is going to be the purveyor of our snickers tonight
Do you like that feeling of tenseness 	 Yeah I like movies that make you sweat
They 're not even going to make the playoffs 	 You 're the one who just lectured me about sticking with your team
Yep no better home field advantage 	 Second I think their division is soft
Why do you say that 	 It is very sad that his parents are killed
I do n't know if it 's true or not 	 I do n't know either I should look that up
Definitely I 'm super excited to see this new installment 	 Did you catch the latest trailer for it
Wow he really took that character on head on did n't he 	 Yes I heard he stayed in character the whole time during filming
She could probably sell them I know collectors would love to have them 	 Do you still have all your old vinyl records I know you had a lot
No definitely go to the movies That 's where the experience is had 	 This is true but they charge so much for movies
Yes 	 That is a sad song
Yeah those actors looked like they were playing dress up in grown up clothes 	 It was weird for me I could have done without that And the creepy Voldemort baby Yuck
Neither have the Houston Texans 	 They used to be called the Oilers
Why is the Pro Bowl so bad 	 I think its a sport that doesnt lend itself to exhbition
I 'm not too into metal but what 's his other stuff like 	 Yeah I 'm not into his heavy stuff but he 's got a new age album lighter rock an album he calls haunted Johnny Cash songs progressive basically anything you could imagine
And just the right amount of romance 	 Exactly
Yes but Replace the old west with Ireland and there you go 	 What do you consider his worst film
Which scene is that I do n't remember exactly 	 You know The scene where Aragorn and the group gather to defend Rohan from the orc army

Is there a difference 	 Yes Little Mix is from the UK
I would n't want my team going to Lambeau in January 	 Yeah for sure the cold is a really big factor
Well this movie specifically paints men out to be a bunch of wife beating rapists 	 Really What is the plot
Well they did change the whole time line about a dozen times 	 The feel was off though not just the plot
I think all those actors have bright futures ahead Oscar Isaac and John Boyega were great in their roles too 	 I agree I ca n't wait for Episode
I have you heard about her latest adventure 	 Are you talking about her being a judge for the new American Idol show
True I ca n't wait until the September 17th game where the Falcons play against the Greenbay Packers 	 Why is that
I will watch them on YouTube really soon 	 I do not think that you will be disappointed
Oh Ilove that movie 	 You sure you do n't have one
Well for example sci-fi is n't reality to me It 's stuff that could happen but probably wont 	 But that 's why I like it so much You sort of get taken away by the fantasty of it all
I just want the plaid one for myself 	 Let 's start on it now
They do actually have always wanted to see them 	 If you hear about a nearby show let me know
Yeah me too This has been way to easy for them 	 Well at least the Finals should be a lot more competitive
Zachary Quinto did a good job as Spock 	 I thought so too though I was n't as convinced by Simon Pegg 's portrayal of Scotty
Yes but it 's also one of my very favorites 	 So long and thanks for all the fish
Oh that is a great tune 	 Do you know who sings that song
I did n't know that 	 It 's really cool how they set it up The dynamic is John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as strangers locked up in the basement and there 's a third guy in there too
How many Spiderman movies are there 	 At least probably with several different versions of Spiderman
Yes but there are some obvious choices 	 For sure The Falcons should really be able to put up some point
Heh Now having the lions on skates THAT would be extra cool I am so there 	 Okay You 're either seriously mistaken or hopelessly brain-damaged I do n't want to talk to you any more
Sure lets do it 	 Fine i am on my way
Yes you can do it through strength 	 Give me an example

You know what movie is a good thriller 	 What movie
A lot of them Disney productions are always great Bambi is one of my favorites 	 Really I have trouble watching that It always makes me cry
Unfortunately they all border more on pop than real dance music 	 At least the radio hits do anyway
I always thought he was a dark character but he had good in him 	 So true as the movies progressed we saw more about his struggles
And then Hound Dog and Blue Suede Shoes are fun 	 He was a great dancer too
Alright I 'll check it out 	 Well you might as well buy your own ticket then
When is the next game 	 It is September against the Vikings and it is also at noon
Of course Kevin Hart had more funny lines He is actually a comedian But The Rock did a good job too 	 Yeah I think you are right He is still getting his comedy acting chops
Some of the best movies are old though 	 Yes but I 've been raised on color TV quick cuts and constant action I ca n't go back to the slow talky-talky films of yesteryear
It 's okay I would dance to it but I 'm not in love with it 	 What about Anitta That was the first time I 've heard of her
Like Cartoons 	 Cartoons or any other ones

I liked all of them but the first one is definitely the best 	 What did you think of Doctor Strange
Seriously 	 No I 'm just kidding My favorite was the first one
Nice 	 Yeah I know the Canadian national anthem 's lyrics thanks to that
It did have that same kind of quality Daisy Ridley was really good in it 	 David Boyega was my favorite new character

How much 	 I got on a vegas line I get if we win Here we go I 'm so excited
I agree At least the raiders picked Las vegas That will make for a fun road trip when they play the cheifs 	 Do you go to a lot of chiefs games
Would you agree that they are some of the best super hero movies 	 Yes some of the best but maybe not the best
Who led Arizona in scoring 	 Trier had points for Arizona
I think the term is used because some bands from the 60s and 70s experimented with a lot of styles and sounds to try and create very unique music Progressive music is also characterized by a high degree of musical prowess 	 What kind of musical prowess do you mean That 's kind of vague
Yeah that 's their most popular album I think That one was probably their last good one 	 That 's a shame What are their other one 's like
Yea he 's the greatest ever 	 Better than Montana
Yeah of the movie has special effects pretty impressive if you compare it to big hero with only 	 That 's impressive the characters and place looked very real
Heart rate breathing behavior and researchers said they showed a decrease in stress levels especially when the music was reggae or soft work 	 So tell me have you tested this out on your dog
yeah he better stick to movies 	 have you seen ti new music video
I think it just makes a more interesting story to do it in a closed office space 	 Yea it 's easier to make a movie about it since the area is n't huge like in the book
Yeah It was cool to see how the actually got the blue prints for the death star 	 Yeah it was How did you feel about the force awakens
I forgot about that Yeah 	 I heard the new Faith Hill and Tim McGraw duet it 's terrible
Oh yeah who is n't They are fabulous Do n't you love how they always sound like a girl group in their early music Like they really just wanted to be a 60s girl group 	 That is so funny I do n't know a lot about that music I will have to look into it
Yeah some of those picks were pretty bad last year 	 Almost threw up in my mouth a couple times last year
Dalmatians 	 Yes I love that one
Let 's play a game 	 What kind of game

I saw it in IMAX 3D as well It 's the only movie I ever paid extra to see it in 	 I wonder where they 'll take the sequels though
what was the washingtion 	 Washington does n't have a steady QB Every year there is an issue
But why that is so unessary I love the new Beauty and the beast movie 	 Yes Emma Watson nailed it She played belle so elegantly
No because I dont have the requisite screen for the theater 	 So would you pay half to watch a new movie at home
Is that the one with Samuel L. Jackson 	 Yep It was my favorite one of them too
They do She does n't mind What 's your favorite song 	 I would have to say Faithfully What about you
His Wolfpack speech was awesome 	 He went to NC State

Well I like Champion 	 Okay what else
The rebels track down the bad guys and try to stop them before destroying the whole Galaxy of rebel bases 	 Is there a lot of people killed
Yeah overall it was pretty good Especially where they show him land the plane 	 Interesting What else is in the movie

I know It is catchy 	 She does a lot for health organizations
So Harry Potter stuff like that 	 I 've seen all the Potter movies That 's sisterly love of course it 's better than wrestling
I heard that she finished filming her part in the next film so Leia 's death wo n't be in that one I think 	 Or maybe they will add in her death into this film

I have heard some of his music it is n't too bad 	 Yes but country is my favorite

You think I 'll like it 	 Probably But it 's actually just a great example of what you can expect from the album
I still think Atlanta has a great team Matt Ryan is so consistent They just have to keep giving the ball to Devonta Freeman He can be a receiver to if they 'd throw it to him 	 Yeah I definitely do n't think Atlanta was a fluke last year But I think Carolina is going to take that division They had a fluke season last year
Whos your favorite baseball team 	 The Cubs Thats a given I am a die hard cubs fan
Yeah 	 Glad you agree

Alright That is a really good song 	 Did you know he died from an Opioid overdose
No not at all since rap clearly sucks 	 What do you take rap to be
Yep Should be a real interesting stretch late in the season with teams that are already fighting hard heading into the playoffs 	 That is some insane scheduling
That 's a pretty huge miss It 's like the center of the whole first movie 	 I guess I better watch it again instead of get distracted
Boys seem to like them more 	 Yeah but they just do n't have the magic of the other Pixar films
Okay 	 A brass band out of Boston
They have to do something or pray they find some decent pieces in the offseason 	 I think their run is over and they need to start over

I 'm a Hawks fan 	 Cool I like the Rockets

It was But to this day Raiders fans dispute the play saying that the ball bounced off Fuqua which means the catch was no good 	 And then the Raiders would have won the game
It 's not a bad thing at all What is it about them that you like 	 Well with rap it 's satisfying to hear so many rhyming sounds in such a short time Plus they can get really clever

Was n't Judy Garland only fourteen when they filmed it 	 Yes she was a very young talented actress

Are they any good 	 Yes very good Their old stuff has some great hits
Ever hit a home run 	 Once It felt awesome

I heard that it just written just with algorithms though 	 What That 's crazy
I think it might be worth checking them out I loved them back in the day 	 So did I The new album is just as good as the old stuff
Yeah but what you do know is probably awesome 	 Like Dust in the Wind
Ha I guess it is cause i never saw it 	 Yeah its better that way the orginal was the best anyway
How so 	 They made him more ditzy and he did not seem as hardcore as he once was
I have a couple that I like 	 If you could turn on just one song what would it be
It had to be he was out for the rest of the season 	 He 's strong The Dolphins training camp starts soon and I 'm sure he 'll be there
Do you like where movies are going today 	 Since we are all family friendly in our peaceful society yes make them more fake and let everything rot
I hope it 's not New England again it 's kind of getting old 	 Yea it would be fun to see a few new teams breakout in
I 'm not sure the story line would be a big hit with todays crowd 	 True But a love story is a love story
If you are able to balance serious issues with lighthearted elements that is a sign of great directing writing and acting 	 Great movie-making overall
His production team is very impressive They have a vast musical knowledge 	 It definitely shows in the new tracks I have heard

I do n't know what it is but I feel the same way 	 We 've become our parents
Do you have any friends that play music 	 I have a lot of friends that play
Cousins is pretty popular as a nice guy and all around good player 	 Do you think they 'll trade him to the 49ers like the rumors have been saying

How 's your dress making business going 	 Surprisingly it 's going OK I 've had five orders this month
Yea that 's pretty funny and not something a real-life villain would have 	 Exactly now that the comic book companies are developing the movies themselves things are much better

Did you see the movie The 	 No
That 's not my favorite either Which one is your favorite 	 I always loved Party in the USA I thought it was so catchy

Yeah it was n't quite what I expected 	 What do you mean
This is his last stand They are not like the Patriots who are stacked on D. 	 Yeah that gives Brady a few extra years before he retires
Are you anticipating any of the new superhero movies coming out this year 	 Yes i ca n't wait to see the Justice League movie
So what 's wrong with that Besides him being a Sith Lord I mean 	 Well the weird thing is that Mas Amedda who was Valorum 's Vice Chancellor stays on as Palpatine 's Vice as well
Maybe not but I guess all the money in it changes things One reason I prefer college ball these days 	 I hear you but watching college ball looks a lot like watching high school ball Not as professional

Hey my daughter is having a play this weekend about The Little Mermaid do you want to go 	 Yes absolutely what part does she play
Where have you been 	 Working I guess I do n't really follow them like that
You want to go see that when it comes out I am sure the others will want to go 	 You have not even asked me what the movie is about
A little fantasy and action put together 	 They do real well with those movies They keep you on the edge of your seat
Wow that 's pretty crazy to think about 	 Yeah it is and he actually tries to betray the rescue team and he ends up killing himself
Ya I loved that you had the Frozen soundtrack playing in the background 	 Ya her favorite song is still Let it Go
its boring 	 you cant expect everyone to be a mos def though
She kept it tasteful though 	 She did I will give her that
Who were the players 	 I remember a few of them Walter Payton was the star running back and William the refrigerator Perry was their main offensive lineman
Me too Ted and Ted were awesome 	 Does he play a character
She did They performed Do n't Dream It 's Over by Crowded House 	 Nice I 'll have to look that one up on YouTube
Carson Palmer has been playing NFL football for seasons he 's running out of time 	 He could have a few more good seasons if he can stay healthy Just look at Tom Brady
I guess 	 I say leave well enough alone
I like the new characters too though I am quite partial to Kylo Ren 	 I like Kylo also and I like Finn as well My favorite character is probably Rey though
Totally 	 Would it kill nicolas sparks to have a happy ending
I SURE DO MISS HIM 	 WHAT SONGS DO YOU LIKE FROM HIM
Yes I am I have to watch every game 	 What do you think of how it went so far
Everybody thought so including me I could n't believe he could play so brilliantly while impaired Turns out it was probably his demons taking over 	 I wonder how much they informed his music
This one has some of the good guys going bad 	 I know I could not understand that
Which one 	 You Make Love Like Springtime Teena be hitting them hight notes I tell you
Yeah of course Mozart died very young 	 Yes at only It was as if the music reflected his life
I dont know if that was that good 	 The change in tempo in much of the song was really well developed
I ca n't believe John Wall hit that last three point shot 	 I know right over Avery Bradley too
Nope It 's pretty dope 	 What 's so different about it
So the stage show was what was so memorable 	 No it was him He took turns playing different instruments singing playing basketball and was great at everything
Nothing like big killer dinosaurs to keep you on your toes 	 That was such a huge spectacle back then
Besides the murder of bin Laden 	 That could but I dont think we know enough to actually make that a legit film

I love ringo and I really like his solo stuff 	 He 's had a lot of hits He 's touring again with an all star band too
I got ta say Elsa from frozen she 's a newer character but already one of the most complex 	 That 's an amazing choice
Wow that 's really tough I would have to say Odell Beckham 	 Not a bad choice I suppose
yes it would have to be Let The Good Times Roll 	 I love the solos in that one
Like what 	 Well for one that Luna can see the ghost horses only those whom have seen death can
Mhm 	 What is wrong with you
It would make a lot of sense if he did 	 Do you think it had an impact on rap music afterwards
Now they have at least one animated project per year 	 And less of the live action films
I bet I would love to see him in concert 	 We just had memphis in may by where I live but there was really nobody good
Yes 	 What do you listen to
Beating a female prisoner does not sound like justice 	 I think the best I can say is that the movie was set in a different time period and that the Hangman could not show any sort of weakness If she had been a man he would have been hitting a man the fact he treats a woman so bad is addressed a few times
Nah man you know I 'm a White Sox fan 	 Oh its easy to forget such a terrible team
True and his smoking hot daughter looks like she could play his reindeer in another movie so its hard to buy their familial relationship 	 One thing that still impresses me about the series is the visual effects they are fantastic
David Bowie 	 He passed away recently very sad
That 's good but not as good as Reflection 	 That 's just because of Lea Salonga

I do n't know much about him but I heard that he has a lot of potential 	 No one will ever be as good as Aaron Rogers am I right
It was definitely landmark when you think about it 	 I can still remember listening to every track
I guess I just thought the character development was better in this one 	 I 'll give you that I liked Newt more than I ever liked Harry
What kind of music do you like the most 	 I really like a bunch of different styles of music
He duplicates himself or so he wants you to think 	 How can he possibly fake that It must be magic
No more like techno/rave music 	 Oh yeah Like Cascada
It is a really great watch a true thriller and it is suspenseful 	 I like those kinds of movies
Did you see the Golden state Warriors versus the Utah Jazz Playoff Game 	 Yeah It was the closest game yet The Jazz seem to be losing by exactly points each of the past games
That 's a shame He reads a lot of Marvel comics 	 I 'm sure his time will come The movie will still be relevant ten years from today

Man this Maidens newest album is so epic 	 Is it
I havent seen it yet 	 It is really good you should watch it
So cool So you will hear a song from an album you once owned but had forgotten 	 Exactly And because I spent so much time here as a kid before I lived here it 's like jumping back to 70s me
Me too Paul Walker was so great in his role 	 Did you notice that they tried to replace him in the latest Furious movie
Yeah me too I think they are from the UK 	 They are old now but I still love their music
Who do you think 	 Doctor Lector
Oh really which song 	 I think it was Ray of Light
I agree we should pick one out to watch 	 That sounds fun what do you have in mind
Yes I did I think that is such an iconic moment Ford was really on the money I think that may veen be my favorite line of Han solo 's 	 I agree it is everything the character of Han is about Ego wit charm I wonder if ford is upset Han died
Maybe the 'll use CGI to bring her back to life for a few scenes in the movie 	 It would be wonderful if they did that I really want to know more about her relationship with Kylo Ren and see them interact
Really 	 Yes he is my favorite rapper
And then there 's that whole scene where his daughter 's boyfriend goes on and on about how he can legally bang her because of the Romeo and Juliet law it 's like what 	 Yeah that kinda weird
The guy is this year so they play pretty well when he is out there 	 There is a little concern over him though because his back tightened up in the 6th inning
I 'm excited for the Redskins I think we 're going to make the playoffs this year 	 Well I think they need to

Are there other movies 	 Yes There are in the series
The premise was very chilling That people who work for the government would allow themselves to have their identities stripped 	 Yes and it was fascinating that Jason wanted to find the truth of how he had gotten to be a killer How to salvage what was left of his life
It is pretty funny to see him with Han Solo 	 Yes they have some interesting conversations
I agree 	 Did you see despicable me
Not good 	 I think he 's on his way out
Dr. Dre also helped the career of Kendrick Lamar a lot too 	 Wow He has really helped shape the face of rap music
And now you 're just being stupid Do n't be silly of course we have to include the silent pictures 	 How do you figure that
Yeah he can not be stopped 	 He 's starting to remind me of Jordan
And there were a few different styles of jazz And Big Band gradually evolved from jazz 	 So was Big Band jazz or was it not jazz

Do you have a favorite Avenger Mine is Captain America 	 Mine too Captain America The Winter Soldier is one of the best Marvel movies

He has room for improvement 	 What happened last season with his game
I like that there 's a little bit more action and things start to get more intense And Tonks I wish we got to see more of her 	 Yeah I could enjoy a whole movie of just Tonks story I did like her more in the books but I think the actress was a good pick

I agree The difference between her performance and Johnny Depp 's performance is astounding 	 Johnny Depp does a good job as the Mad Hatter but I honestly thought his performance was a little lackluster in Alice Through The Looking Glass
I do n't know I find the orchestra distracting 	 I saw Back to the Future with live orchestra and it made it so much better
Really 	 I do n't like when animals are killed in movies even if it 's not real

Bieng a huge Harry Potter fan I would say the Deathly Hallows movie 	 Who directed that one was it the same as the other movies
It seems a lot of great comedic actors made a name for themselves on Saturday Night Live 	 Of course And then there is Michael Richards who was hilarious on the show Fridays
I see you 've brought it back to the Packers So you are confident this year 	 Of course Nelson is the best receiver in the league Rodgers is the best QB the defense will be much better because we have more inexperienced rookies in the secondary and we have a brand new running back that has n't yet been physically broken down by a full season of games
Eli Manning 's been there before he knows how to win 	 I love teams with great defenses They always seem to do well in the playoffs
Makes sense 	 Where should I see the first one
Their loss I say It could have been pretty hilarious 	 Hey he still would have been playing a cowboy But I guess the purists would have freaked out if he racist jokes
Yes that is correct but it had a great cast 	 Who else was in it
That 's when he was getting a lot of praise and people were calling him a freak of nature 	 I could n't believe that he healed that fast and was better than ever after that injury
Do you listen to rap 	 Sometimes I like Chance the Rapper Have you ever heard of him
I would say it is okay but not as good as their last album Helplessness Blues 	 There does seem to be a lot of good new albums coming out recently Have you heard Lourde 's new album Melodrama
I like the one with Justin Timberlake 	 I like anything with Justin Timberlake
Well personally I do n't listen to Rihanna but she 's not really known for being classy 	 Meaning why am I listening to her
The squirrel in that movie was cute and it was funny how he bonded with Kronk 	 Did you ever see the sequel Kronk 's New Groove
Do you think he is better than Randy Lerner 	 I 'm not really sure Randy lerner at least did everything he could to get the right people involved
I feel sad that her name will always be associated with this tragedy 	 I hope that she can put this behind her to focus on what really counts the music
But every coach will give bad advice sometimes 	 He should be more professional and make fewer mistakes with the team
Do you have a favorite player 	 No actually I do n't
Are you making an economic argument That when there is an unlimited supply you might value each product less 	 Sort of but it 's more nuanced than that
It is nice for the soldiers to see famous people pay tribute to them 	 Kelly said it was amazing to be able to help shine a light on these heroes and there should be more moments like this
What the heck is a D-VHS 	 It was a VHS format that released for home use in It was basically true 1080i HD quality film but on a VHS
Nope still a free agent 	 And so is Kapernick right
Did he 	 Yes he directed The Fly
I think that Biggie was better than Tupac but i think that had both lived later in life they would have played out 	 What do you mean

I do n't teally like country 	 What about classical music like Nach or Beethoven
Yeah and as they evolved they went more rock 	 But they broke on to the scene quickly

No I have n't Is it any good 	 Yeah I love it I watch it all the time
If I had to pick a team to get next year I would go with the Jets 	 Yeah they are a straight mess

What are some movies that you would recommend for guys 	 New films
How many games do you go to each year 	 Maybe or so depending on how well they are doing
I do not know what are you in the mood for 	 I sort of want something that is down to earth
He can play man He 's a great defender 	 Overrated Check out his UZR

Despite what the name implies they 're more of an alternative or indie-rock group 	 That 's definitely my scene are there any of their songs I might know
I 'm making good progress but I ca n't find Presence 	 I think I have that album lying around the house somewhere I know back in the days I had doubles of all their albums If I find it I can give it to you

You outta know I think it is such an anthem for so many women 	 Ya so many of her songs are the type you just want to sing your heart out along to
Five years from now Geno could easily get double what EJ makes five years from now 	 It 's a shame too EJ 's talent is wasted on the Bills

Well yeah he 's the main character 	 I mean instead of it being an Avengers-focused movie
I figured he 'd be great in it De Niro is a ridiculously versatile actor 	 Yes he can do comedy and drama equally well now He 's awesome

I have mixed feelings The title track is weird because it sounds cluttered 	 Yeah the song 's music video with the USC marching band kind of muffles the song
Well the show ended so well had tied everything together so wonderfully totally stasified with each storyline 	 I do agree the end to the show felt very satisfying for all characters
Can you believe how many fast and the furious movies there are 	 I know it 's almost crazy that they keep making them but they are so good
I thought that this movie had a better villain overall than the first but the silliness was overwhelming 	 How so
The Saints are in New Orleans 	 How did they do last year
The AFC is n't really going to be much competition for them short of injury to Brady Did you see Deion Sanders was calling for SD to trade Rivers to Denver 	 Man that would be sweet Philip Rivers is a fucking tool but Rivers and Demaryius Thomas That defense I 'd like to see Denver vs New England in the playoffs if Rivers is at QB in Denver
So you really would n't watch Jurassic Park 	 Too scary I do n't like to watch people get eaten

Maybe my team will win the superbowl this year 	 I doubt it

Yeah it was Well I 'll see you on the first kick off next month 	 Sounds good Football is almost back
I wonder if they 'll introduce more Wookies in the new trilogy 	 Maybe a Wookie spin off
Probably due to the graphic nature of some of the lyrics 	 Probably also due to the language in the music

I love all his movies 	 Me oo all his and Gerrard butler
I dont watch girl movies 	 Do you like the Rock
Do you think the players kneel went against that morality clause in their contract 	 Yes because the level of disrespect they showed was not just to the flag but to every military person every citizen in our great nation And they make millions with no retribution for their disrespect
Most fans agree with you and I think Caldwell will be fired if we do n't win a playoff game next year 	 It 's been forever since you 've won one so it might be a longshot

Me too 	 And he can hear what your thinking
Movie tickets are kind of pricey these days especially iMax ones 	 Definitely maybe it is better for it to just come out for rent
I guess all we have to do is become professional football players and win the Super Bowl 	 Oh is that all
Right but but if we don t have the flames the rnold fighting the Satan is much less dramatic It IS about the End of Days after all 	 ys but they have to make it believable Now it 's just stupid and funny

Is it the one called Walking The Wire 	 Yeah that 's the song Do you like it

another one I have never heard of haha 	 Fifth favorite song is Panama by Van Halen
I like to listen to the instrumental stuff and have it playing in the background while I 'm working 	 Copy that Celtic music is great because even when you 're doing something it makes you feel like you 're somewhere else magical and antique

Same here it seems that the Foo Fighters try new things out a lot 	 Oh yeah they have done quite a variety of music

Awesome 	 How much longer you think it will be
What was the name of that movie from the 's where the nanny terrorizes the house 	 The Hand That Rocks The Cradle
Well basically if it has kind of postive or happy sound to it there 's a good chance it 's written in a major key 	 That sounds like a lot of different scales to learn for a musician

So like The Climb 	 Yeah kind of It was n't bad
Did you hear any more about the Raiders moving to Vegas 	 I thought it was a done deal

The version 	 Was it directed by the same guy who did Night of the Living Dead
Yeah that was a good album 	 I also liked Just Another Girl
What do they sing 	 A lot of electronic music I 'll send you their big hit on YouTube later

The way Travis does in Taxi Driver 	 Crazy The movie has some other great characters as well Albert Brooks Peter Boyle
Possum Vultures The Horse Llama The Sloth Wombat I could go on if you want 	 That 's okay I get the idea Are all their songs about animals
Mostly that 's it It 's far more recycled than the others 	 The death star narrative repeating itself
I guess he 's a regular Jack of all trades 	 He 's also a licensed Airline Transport Pilot and a Certified Flight Instructor
You should check them out 	 I definitely will now
You did n't like the 3D one 	 Nah I 'm just not a fan of any 3D movies

They 're two of his greatest hits I 'm sure you 've heard them before 	 Where is Billy Joel from
Its my favorite sport 	 Its definitely my favorite sport

Because i liked the old ones 	 It is nothing like those though
Did you see a lot of live shows 	 Yes They had shows at the Mississippi River Festival that brought in a lot of groups
I had forgot about that one Either of those songs are fine with me 	 Besides the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC what were some other popular boy bands from the nineties
The star is Zoey Deutch She played in Vampire Academy a few years ago 	 That one was based on a book too right
How do you think the team as a whole will do this year 	 Hopefully better than last year
What Thats how baseball exists 	 I just dont see how thats a stat though you cant control guys getting on ahead of you
It was when he trusted Luke too much it almost got him killed and so many others 	 Luke made his choices
Yes anything classic cut or with a collar and buttons looks professional Did you know Forever does have professional-looking button ups for sale 	 Haha you 're really trying to convince me to shop there huh It 's quite alright I do go there sometimes for basics Like I get my tank tops from there
It could be a very historic match up 	 Are you a fan of either team
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
In addition to I love you I know Empire has the best lines 	 Very true and they leave us in suspense as to what will happen next after Luke is rescued
I think it might have been her best one yet I liked In the Zone but Circus was really just a little better 	 Really you think so I loved that song Everytime It really showed that she could do ballads and not just pop
Still I would rather be in that position than not making the playoffs at all 	 I know Being a Packers fan has spoiled me a little
Yeah that is strange 	 Anyhow I just bought the DVD if you 'd like to see it again
Her performance was amazing though 	 For sure i could never do that now let alone if I were pregnant with twins
That 's amazing I love when big studios try to do good things 	 I know I mean it 's Disney They could have cast Selena Gomez and called it a day
No I did n't know that 	 They even released a Christmas album called Christmas Collection and another one called Christmas Portrait
I think so Did n't they do that song called Right Now 	 Yeah that 's them I liked that song a lot It was very catchy
think it 's that the guy that trained him ends up being the guy he has to kill 	 Oh cool who 's in it
I would have to say Faithfully What about you 	 I would have to go with Do n't stop Believing It 's so great
Yes and luck plays a pretty big factor in team success 	 I agree but given a clean slate of health the Browns may surprise some people
What happens after that 	 He then buys a car and leaves on the street When two gang members try to steal it and threaten him with a knife he shoots both of them
What are you up to this weekend 	 Will probably take in a movie

The 50s were too poppish All of the good bands emerged during Vietnam 	 Which one is your favorite
it 's terrifying to think about but I have seen some recent tech trends trying to push into that direction 	 Human just want to get lazy do n't they
Hah why on Earth would anyone want to listen to that 	 Well there 's something really primal about the rapper of the group MC Ride He sounded funnny at first but the more you listen the more you get into the obscure energy of his performance
They played that at my church in middle school 	 That 's sacreligious
yes the father says you 'll live forever if you give up all the things that make you want to 	 Did it win any awards
Wow that is nuts 	 So by moving Carr will save over million in taxes compared to California
What is softer rap what does that mean 	 Basically it 's like a pop song with a piano and it has some rapping in it so it 's not like gangster rap at all
No the album itself just got so popular all the songs on it became huge 	 Crazy to think what happened to Axl Rose when you look at him in the 90s
Did you know they were going to make a second Beetlejuice 	 Really
The Packers are an odd duck a passing game with hardly anything else They hardly evoke the Mike Holmgren Brett Favre successes let alone the glory years of Lombardi and Starr 	 Maybe the Giants fit in this category also
Not bad I was intrigued by the Cassian Andor as a terrorist 	 Who played Andor
Edward Scissorhands 	 Is Johnny Depp in that one
They can still concentrate on Han Solo and Luke Skywalker 	 Yes and well that 's good it wo n't be quite the same
Have you watch the last Jason Bourne movie 	 I have n't

Yeah man exactly 	 I 'm a big fan of Hot Chip but there is no space to dance at the Mint venue
Oh yeah and then Lady Gaga was on Beyonce 's Video Phone 	 That 's right They were both great pop songs
But they are cool 	 Not it is lame
Do you believe the rumors that Biggie Smalls killed him 	 It would make a lot of sense if he did
Yes it is 	 I know about it but I never watched it

Maybe you should use the country artists who sing gospel songs 	 That is a great idea
That sounds good what kind of bands were they 	 They had Imagine Dragons Breaking Benjamin U2 and Red Hot Chili Peppers in the ad

Most people think of betting the game and lines but what value do proposition bets bring to this event Does it bring the once-a-year type of bettor -LRB- marginal -RRB- into the equation Do prop bets get more action than traditional bets 	 Prop bets are something we take pride in we offer prop bets throughout the whole year in every sport entertainment politics and business but there is no question that the Super Bowl prop bets started the popularity of this type of wagering About of our new clients that sign up leading up to Super Bowl their first bet ever is on some sort of prop so that shows the significance props play in our business

I heard LT was actually pretty upset about it 	 I could imagine
Wonder if he is working with Snoop 	 I bet he is
Okay so why did n't that create tension throughout the film 	 Because he did n't want any trouble He had gone legit and was going to become a town 's sheriff

So in the new point system there could be a lot more field goal kicking 	 Yes this would definitely change the game from a ground game -LRB- pass or running play -RRB- to more of a skill game for the kickers
Wow all by yourself 	 Yeah with that same glove I gave you -LRB- looks down at the glove he gave to billy last year for t-ball -RRB-

The competition level hasnt been to the point where you need to make a splash 	 So we could see a team just promote from within
It does come out of left field 	 Exactly The revelation makes little sense given what came before It was just a neat way to end the love triangle

Well these are sports experts and they know more about this than we do 	 True but like with everything there is a bit of common sense with everything Somethings they do make no sense

I was really hoping that New England would have lost last years Superbowl 	 I had hoped the same but the Falcons really gave them a run for their money
But there were n't any people in the Lion King so how will any of it be live action 	 Most of the Jungle Book was CGI so I guess all of the movie will be CGI

Exactly 	 Yeah I was a bit underwhelmed considering all the praise it received
Me either no idea who the villain is Was Superman going to be in it 	 I 'm not really sure he 's on some of the promo material but as of the last movie he 's well dead
He has a good chance Harry Styles could too 	 Harry 's new album is so different from his One Direction songs
Team America was such a perfect copy of the marionettes in Thunderbirds and at the same time a total sendup that was fearless in its comedy 	 I got a kick out of the goofiness of marionette movement and the lip moves and stuff that was a constant funny throughout the whole thing
All the animated movies from that time period were great They do n't call it the Disney Renaissance for nothing 	 That 's true

It is really As the doctors are standing over him wondering aloud how he is even alive he hears how bad he is and starts to lose it 	 Well who wo n't

Have you seen the movie They 're Watching 	 I think so is that the movie with Brigid Brannagh
They do have Paxton Lynch who seems very young but promising I think if anyone can help him it 's Elway 	 Oh for sure Elway has a way with quarterbacks since he has so much experience of his own
So do I It was the perfect film to grow up with 	 I might still play the songs and sing along all the time in my car
They were decent but i just felt something off 	 Well okay which one do you like more then
That team has had changes lately 	 Yes new players
Cody Bellinger hit a homer 	 So they threw at the next batter
That 's true and they might want to give him a better contract so they do n't lose him to another team 	 It would be a shame if they lost him to another team because they do n't appreciate his talent
me too 	 some spanish
I told you 	 Did any famous players play there
For sure most definitely 	 What kind do you like
Deshawn Watson is itching to get on the field as well 	 Oh cool he was having some trouble last year
I would recommend Stanley Jordan 	 I bet one 's fingers get worn out in a new kind of way
Well the Spurs did win out of during the regular season 	 The regular season does n't matter anymore though the playoffs is its own season

You can pull it up on youtube 	 You got me just about to do that I hope my neighbors do n't complain

Yes it was my kids loved it too 	 I 've been meaning to see it
He 's just really raw His voice is awesome but he 's not flawless because the character would n't be 	 So he 's really acting the songs instead of just singing pretty

Colors of the Wind is probably the most popular 	 Oh I love that song
I 'm a Viking fan 	 Oh wow the Super Bowl is in Minnesota this year
Have you seen Collateral 	 Whos in that movie
But I thought it was as big as a planet 	 No more like the size of a small moon

For some people each timbre produces its own color For others certain chords certain keys and so forth 	 That does n't sound consistent

Watt on the bench due to injury than the previous five seasons 	 It was because the AFC South is one of the worst divisions in the NFL and their first Wild Card Game was against the Oakland Raiders who lost Derek Carr to injury the previous December
No way Gone are the days of EPMD Nas is still out there not making music so much but still on point 	 I know I loved EPMD Strictly Business and You Gots to Chill were my joints
Like who 	 Will Ferrell has had way more funnier movies

What music do you listen to during exercise 	 I like techno or house music while I workout

The players now seem drab 	 Not all of them
That 's true but it made him a good villain 	 Barbossa was n't as creepy I ended up liking him a lot
Gal Gadot was terrifc in the movie and the action scenes were well done 	 I really like the setting it made the movie more dynamic
One of my favorites 	 I also like Dig a Pony
Remember that scene in Fast Five where Dom and Brian drive off a bridge and survive 	 Yea that was pretty ridiculous Or the scene in the 7th where they drive through buildings
I 'm not sure I mean I figure they ca n't all be wrong 	 I agree I 'll have to watch it
That 's kind of the way that I thought it would go So Batman 's not in the movie at all 	 Well let me explain first Captain Trevor saves the world by sacrificing himself in an act where he takes a bomber filled with deadly gas to a high altitude and detonates it killing himself in the process
There 's just so much energy at their concerts 	 I know I love when they just go off script and jam and then manage to bring it all back together

Really 	 Boston 's been killing it hard
I love a song called shine on 	 I dont know if I 've heard that one

Building 	 Yeah constructing
Levis makes a great pair of boyfriend jeans They are relaxed fit but not so baggy that they 're sloppy looking 	 Great I think I 'll try to find a low cut pair Maybe something destroyed in a medium wash
Yeah but I think it 's nice that he realized he does n't have to be perfect 	 That 's true He was able to write the essay at the end in only a few lines on who they were
It was the movie I think I want to watch it tonight 	 Bourne Identity was good so You should be safe on this one

Me to They 're great together 	 As for Adam the worst movie he ever did is The Water Boy
To be honest I do n't listen to much American pop I like metal and rock better 	 Yeah I can understand that Metal and rock are really intense and have a totally different sound
Well they might settle for Goosebumps if they ca n't check out adult movies but I 've had 9-year-olds who want to check out The Exorcist and Rings 	 Really Those movies are too scary for me and I 'm an adult
They are getting much worse What do you think 	 I think the quality of movies is getting worse too
Do you want kickoffs abolished 	 I wouldnt mind having each team starting at the
Did I ever listen Yes and I still do 	 Really I thought Garth Brooks was long gone
I do n't know I think each movie gets more unrealstic 	 You 're totally right the action scenes Dom and his team do are n't believable
Do you think there will be more Fast Furious movies in the future 	 Almost definitely yes I think the fan base of this franchise has very low standards and probably wants more
No I have n't watched it 	 I saw it yesterday It was really cool
I did n't know that either until recently 	 They also did Guardians of the Galaxy I love that one
No I always seem the miss the shows when he is local to me He was at the Country but I was out of town at a wedding 	 Isnt that the big festival where he played along with Blake Shelton Miranda etc
He needs to become a pocket passer That would suit them well 	 They do n't have any receivers though
It seemed nobody wanted to take a chance on him 	 The Vikings wanted to move on and I do n't blame them
Have you seen all the Star Wars movies 	 Kind of I watched them all with my husband before The Force Awakens came out
Do you think you could show me how to play 	 Sure
Shes not an actress actresses express emotion 	 I dont know how she got the job
I will give props to Zack Snyder though for the excellent visuals of the movie 	 That 's one thing no critic can take away from Snyder The man really knows how to make things look good for the camera
She has newer ones I think 	 Do you know what it is called
Yea I have n't seen a really good comedy that I really enjoyed in recent memory 	 Like I said before all the best comedies were made in the 's
Yes but it 's not really that weird 	 Really
I think one of the criticisms was the huge budget 	 But it 's all there on the screen at least It 's a feast for the eyes
Would you call that a thriller 	 Yeah the hunt for the murderer was epic
Who is your favorite player 	 I like Odell Beckham
O yeah for sure grandmaster flash was a pioneer he paved the way for hip hop 	 You can not forget about the sugar hill gang though
That was definitely released on Forever Now 	 Yes it was I have a copy in my car
I like most kinds of music but it depends on what I 'm doing at the time That determines the music that I listen to 	 I know what you mean If you look at my music list on my phone you would have no idea what my favorite is
I never got too much into those discussons I just like to listen to the music 	 Oh so what punk bands do you like
It is a really upbeat song I like to dance too 	 Same here it is a really catchy song
That 's it 	 Yes the music made before the Industrial Revolution classical music was analog Since that change music has become machine-like
Do you like rock 	 Yes
I did I loved it 	 She sang it at an awards show right
My parents had barely seen it either Here 's to hoping 	 Let 's go Chiefs
How do you like Biggie 	 He was so good So tragic that he had to die Him and Tupac both
Yes except he lied a lot to keep up this fake front of being successful but he was basically homeless 	 Sounds interesting
Me too it was pretty bad I love when the girl Samara steps out of the tv screen though 	 That never gets old to me I always wonder though why do n't they just pull the plug
Yeah it is n't too bad It makes me want to go on vacation somewhere tropical 	 The ending is really fun And those songs will be stuck in your head
I just saw White Chicks 	 That movie was funny
And James Earl Jones 	 Yeah the others were all kids
Right 	 They are decent
Tell me something about the Beatles that you thought was questionable or very different about their music 	 I always thought that their travelling to India was pretty weird
Yea I 'm too poor 	 Me too
I 'd have to say Airbud 	 I forgot about that movie
He plays mainly rock music 	 Oh ok I will have to check him out
What other action movies did he play in 	 He did a bit of fighting in Point Break
I have never seen that I have heard good things though 	 I do n't think it will let you down But if you want another suggestion I would look for the older movie Planes Trains and Automobiles
Yeah it was I liked him too and details of the movie 	 I thought it was interesting to see the creation of the Death Star what about you
That 's terrible did they ever find out what happened 	 No it 's still a mystery There are a number of theories there was some heavy fog and they think the wings might have iced up and they crashed in the channel a bomber group was also returning after having to abort their mission because of the weather and it was standard procedure to drop their bombs into the English Channel rather than risk landing with a full bomb load and the bombers were coming over the same area of the English Channel as Glenn 's plane was going in the opposite directions so they think if Glenn 's plane was flying low splashes from the bombs or the concussions from them could 've knocked him down
Who was the other guy in the group 	 Guy Sigsworth And he 's worked with a lot of big names Bjork even
that 's the magic part of it is n't it 	 haha indeed I got ta go check out her new music videos on Youtube
I think it 's okay but is n't it just made for kids 	 Sure but a lot of it is written quite well especially the more modern stuff and many of it has won Grammys and Oscars
That sounds interesting 	 It 's got a on Rotten Tomatoes
Not to me 	 Well then you 're missing out on some beautiful and meaningful music
ok great I will call you tomorrow 	 ok I will talk to you soon
Yes because afterall the game does n't really matter 	 It 's just another way for the NFL to make money off the players
Really That 's awesome Did you know they came out with a new Album 	 Yea I heard but I have n't had a chance to listen to it
He definitely needs plenty of screen time 	 I hope Harrison Ford makes some type of appearance in it
Revenge of the Sith right I get some of the prequels mixed up 	 Yeah that 's it I really did n't think it was as bad as others seem to
Yes I love all three 	 There are
Lindor is from Puerto Rico I saw the Astros play the Marlins in an international game in Puerto Rico last night 	 That 's awesome I did not know they did that
She totally stole that movie from Kristin Wiig She was good in Tammy too 	 Yeah but Wiig got to film a bedroom scene with Jon Hamm
I agree thats why I love him so much you can just feel all of the words 	 And how cute is he
Hey who do you thing we 'll see in The Last Jedi what new or old faces 	 Well we may see the kids of Wedge Antillies provided he had any
I already started listening on the internet 	 That 's great
What do you think about beyonce 	 Yeah I like her too shes been around for a while now and I find myself listening to a lot of her music

Shakira is amazing What about Joan Jett 	 With the Runaways or the Blackhearts
Can you gice me sone examples 	 I like some of Kenny Rogers 's songs

I really like country music from the 's 	 Me too Do you remember Kenny Rogers
Is part good 	 Yes but the first one is way better
It 's awesome 	 Well you seem pretty excited
Except for the fact that it meant Simba was just going to leave behind everyone he loved 	 Let 's give Simba a break here okay His evil Uncle Scar tricked him into thinking he killed Mufasa
What about the players that do n't want to use it 	 Well then that 's their choice They do n't have to use it
I know sometimes I ca n't figure them out 	 I like John fox as a head coach though
That 's good I think it 's important for girls to have role models 	 Yeah I think that Riley from Inside out is a great role model
Beyonce is a certified poet 	 Do you listen to any other musician
I ca n't believe it has been so long 	 I remember that on the day it was released I went to the book store dressed as Professor Dumbledore
What about it that was a play 	 Yeah but turned into a movie
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
It amazes me that even today those special effects are still relevant 	 And do n't forget how the movie has held up for generations
I 'm going to have to download some of their stuff 	 Be sure to download the Low End Theory It 's their best
No I think that it could cause problems 	 Teams would just join up together
What do you think of Frozen 	 I really like the movie in general but I saw a lot of behind the scenes clips that would have made the movie so good
A shooting star Make a wish 	 Hmmmmm
I would say that tops my list as well 	 Which one did you like the least
But I dont see it as actually pat of the series 	 Yea it 's more of a spinoff
Do you think they were jealous 	 Somewhat Many of these guys were in absolutely fantastic bands that never received the kind of attention the White Stripes did Maybe they felt they deserved it more It was a strange time
Did you like the 3rd movie 	 It was okay
I like many different kinds of movies but I hate horror movies 	 So I guess you have n't seen any horror movies then
I have never heard of that What is it about 	 It is so good It is about a man who decides he wants to have a procedure done to erase his memory
New genre what do you mean 	 It 's called vaporwave It 's like an internet subculture
Did she stop them 	 She stopped them and eliminated the frozen ones too
You guys need to get rid of a few people too Eitherway we will do the same thing we did last year with you guys Win 	 I doubt that Dak and your RB were new and there was no film on them Now everybody has something to study and find out their quirks
Tony Banks I believe He was atrocious as well 	 I remember him He was pretty bad
It seems like it has been gone for such a long time We are getting close at least 	 I am excited to start having my Detroit Lions watch parties again You will have to come over this Fall
Who you rooting for I know you like Dallas but 	 Nah I am still a Cowboys fan always Dak Prescott and Zeke Elliott are the Boys these days
The Crucible was good 	 I did like it
Haha yeah I 've seen several of those It 's a trap related memes on various place on the web One I liked shows young Boba holding his father 's helmet and it says Take your son to work day Not always successful 	 Oh that 's terrible Funny but terrible
Yeah he has toned down quite a bit since his early days 	 I think that Snoop Dogg has stayed relevant
That 's right they were all rioting about how Scarlett Johansson 's character should 've been played by an Asian actress 	 Yeah it 's seriously not a big deal since the original character of the Major is suppose to be somewhat ambiguous in ethnicity
Of course My favorite is The Goblet of Fire 	 Really Why
Which do you like better the Monkees as a TV show or the Monkees as a musical group 	 Definitely like the music better than the TV show
I think so too 	 I do n't think I would want to be an NFL coach
Oh that 's cool I 'll occasionally play but I like to put a little extra money on it to keep it interesting at least lose buys lunch sort of thing 	 Ah I could get into that Might have to play with you this year
That franchise has so many too many 	 I think Star Wars will be the same just keep making them
If I had to choose one thing I 'd say the setting 	 All of the different planets and things like that
What do you think was the best of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies 	 Probably the middle one with the Joker
Man this new guy i have been listening to is legit 	 Who is he
Yeah he did for sure Hope he gets to drop a mainstream album soon 	 He is working with Jadakiss so hopefully he could get his foot in the door
Why do you say that 	 Zeke and Dak were good last year but rookies sometime take backward steps
It could have been much worse 	 I know He could have lived with all those kids at the Weasley 's
Maybe it was there way of making him not looking so bad 	 The three bird mascots of the Baltimore Ravens are named Edgar Allan and Poe
Well unless you exclude Batman Forever 	 Of course I assumed that was a given
I agree It was smart exciting and appealing to a wide audience I have n't seen anything like it from DC 	 I do think Gal Gadot 's scenes in Batman Vs. Superman were the best things about that movie
I could n't watch that one from beginnning to end It just was n't that funny 	 The movie he did on there with David Spade was pretty funny though
Well l they 're not really games as much as a show case 	 Show case for what
Do you like Metallia 	 Heck yeah I do They are amazing
Maybe that 's the key Rushing yards per game 	 Not really because top rushing team are Buffalo Dallas Tenessee San Francisco

Did you Did you wear the super tight pants too 	 Of course And my bum looked great

I liked Feists Lonely Lonely on The L Word 	 Yes that was heartbreaking
I liked it as well I thought the acting by George Cloony and Hugh Laurie was great 	 Yes Hugh played the villain perfectly
All of the other members of AC/DC are phenomenal but you first notice that lead singer 	 You 're right I do n't know how diehard fans of AC/DC are going to feel about Axl singing lead

Stephen Curry Kevin Durant Andre Iguodala Draymond Green Ian Clark and Javale Mcgee Half of the Warriors team 	 What was the fundraiser for How is the Warriors score right now
There are tons of action movies but few have really god character development or interesting plot 	 What abut the Transformers That was a good series
Yeah they 're good I like Thinner IT Christine and Pet Cemetary 	 Pet Cemetary was crazy scary Have you seen the first one
I do n't know exactly but it 's over years now 	 Wow do they still have all of their original members
The police had stopped his car because he was falling asleep behind the wheel so he stayed at a motel one night 	 And then what happened
Then it shows him running back and fourth with more carts full 	 What then more flashes
This is hard work 	 Tyler helped me so maybe you could practice with him too
Oh definitely it has a great sound 	 I will go ahead and buy the album if I like it
Classic tearjerker scene my man 	 Really but you know I think I 've cried harder with a different movie
It seems silly to me Anyway I wonder who will be the most improved team this year 	 People say Titans but will see I love Mariota so seeing him get one of the best WR is a good thing
Are you looking forward to the new NFL celebration rules 	 Not really Goodell found a way to make it less fun even though they are allowing more of a celebration
His orchestral suite number 	 Ok obviously do n't know it
They made that poor little boy seem creepy 	 They did but it was an overall good movie
Do you think the Golden State Warriors are the best team in the league right now 	 With Kevin Durant and Steph Curry they are probably the best overall team this year
Not really I like there Quarter back Russell Wilson 	 Do you think Russell Wilson is a better quarterback than Cam Newton
I reminds me off a recent break up So I can relate to this particular song 	 It really is a really good song and Blake Sheldon is awesome as always
Hey 	 Hi
They are hitting the ball like the bronx bombers of old 	 I know this Aaron Judge is a monster of a man
If I had to say it would be rock 	 Do you like hard rock
I think you are right that an A-line would definitely be the best way at sticking with a classic style that wo n't look dated 	 Luckily lace is coming back into fashion Even though it goes in an out I think lace is a good idea if you like it
Yea the NFL 	 I love it Season ticket holder
I do n't know I do n't really have a favorite Who 's yours 	 My favorite is Dmitri Shostakovich
Yeah that 's true The therapist should have seen it coming but she was blind 	 I do n't understand though how anyone could be kidnapped in broad daylight
Every down he just never learned how to use his players 	 His blind faith in his system is what killed him
What are some of your favorite bands that have slid into obscurity 	 Well I think Linkin Park would be one
I think it was to keep it to a certain time 	 Still
My marine buddies and I listen to them all the time to get pumped up 	 Yes I can imagine that their music does have a good beat
Yeah their sound was one of a kind even though it was drawn from so many other bands 	 That Springsteen Jersey sound jived so well with their punk roots there 's a void there for sure
Yes 	 Did a lot of people die
I know Do you got their latest album 	 I do I 'd been waiting a long time for it I 've got all their albums
They 'll be at University of Phoenix Stadium like last year 	 Oh I did n't go to them last year
They did go last season and gathered up their fifth Lombardi trophy 	 Indeed and with the additions of a few players they look even better on paper for this season
The thing I fall in love with is how he uses his face It 's like a whole genre of comedy 	 Yeah like in Dumb and Dumber I especially liked his improvisation in that with the most annoying sound in the world
That 's true other than the Texans I do n't see the Colts or Jaguars as posing much of a threat 	 I ca n't fully rule out Andrew Luck with the Colts because he 's such a good quarterback
Maybe they 're in cahoots And he 'll take over with Palpatine dead 	 Maybe I have a good idea
I think it 's cool 	 Do you think the baby really hears it
Who does that 	 I know
What do you think of it Is it anything like their old songs 	 It seems more produced than straight instruments Almost like synthesized drums
There 's so many good ones it 's hard to choose just one but I also liked The Jungle Book 	 Why do you like The Jungle Book
I have not seen anyone perform it as good 	 I know right
What was the worst movie for you of last year 	 I am not entirely sure because i have not watched to many movies last year
-LSB- sarcastically -RSB- How 'd you know 	 There are a few other guest artists featured right
I ca n't wait to draft Mike Evans in fantasy this year That guy always puts up points 	 He is a top receiver You better grab him quick
That movie is hilarious I love when the SNL stars get into a movie together What part was your favorite 	 I loved when they took the baby classes And Dax Shepard 's character was so funny
Have you seen any good thriller films lately 	 Yea I saw The Butterfly Effect
Definitely I truly do not know anyone who dislikes that movie 	 Is it just the original that you love or the entire trilogy
A lot of people had never heard of him 	 Do you think Justice League will be good
So would you say the Joshua Tree is now on play at classic rock stations 	 Definitely though its hard to believe
Most of it but not the whole thing no It 's set throughout Korea too 	 That sounds like an interesting concept
Six times I was so excited about it 	 Wow that 's more than me I 've only seen it twice
So amateurs are allowed to use aluminum 	 Yes Amateurs at collegiate and below can use either wooden or aluminum bats Except in high school there is one more rule
Maybe I personally loved the songs in Moana 	 Me too I feel like Disney is really having a big revival recently
And they got the nerve to have a nice little cast in there 	 See told you You gone be front and center
Hey thanks for the information I will take your recommendation seriously 	 Yes make sure to go see it you will love it
Well they just hired some new folks to change up their logo and marketing Maybe that will help 	 I certainly hope so I hope that with the refresh they will be able to continue to look forward
Wow That 's crazy 	 Yeah Will smith is a doctor that tries to expose to the world the major head injuries caused by football
No not at all I mean you will know most of what happens but you will still like it 	 But do n't I know it all already Reading the books after the movies seems like overkill
It 's so sad he had to die the way he did 	 Yeah luckily he left a giant legacy behind him
Me too I really loved Hey Jude Let It Be Yellow Submarine Rocky Raccoon and so many more 	 I did too I loved the Sargent Pepper Album the songs were great
That is an incredible season 	 If he can keep that up next season they will have a good chance of going far in the playoffs
Okay Did it have cars in it 	 It was not a Fast and the Furious movie if that 's what you 're getting at
Have you seen her on the voice 	 She was amazing
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
No does he sound like Tech 	 Not really I mean he 's a rapper but not the machine gun style rapping like Tech nine
Got ta hand it to Link Park though I never expected them to last as long as they have 	 True true They 've really evolved and grown as artists and keep coming out with great new stuff except Reanimation of course
A win is a win and you get them where you can 	 Do you think they have a chance to win it all this year
oh that is awesome 	 and we will see the sth again
the new album sounds so happy but hayley is so sad there 	 her lyrics are more emo than ever to be honest
I have grown to like her but did n't like the way she dressed 	 You see that she does n't dress so crazy now or cover her face
That scene with the truck though in the movie is amazing 	 I love that scene it is so intense
empire has a lot of hits out 	 Thats a excellent show for music
I absolutely hear that Gone are the days of John Elway but we can always hope a miracle happens and Denver 's QB manifests this season with a fraction of Elway 's powers my friend 	 Well if we just have an exciting season will make it worth it it has been a long time since I viewed a Broncos game that might be deemed boring one-sided or unsurprsing
What 's up man You ready to watch the nfl 	 Sure am Too bad you do n't have any team to root for now
Yes There is no song like Hey Jude out there 	 That song is so long and amazing
About twelve I liked him before that but I really into his music after Diamonds Pearls 	 By then I was listening to Salt n Peppa
Do you like all those cool cars in the movies like the Honda Civic Coup.and the Ford 	 Yes there is also was a scene in the movie were someone is driving a cool Mitsubishi Gto car
True The set was really beautiful though I enjoyed it 	 Definitely I love Emma Watson
That 's probably true A lot of the smaller schools can really compete 	 Did you think Villanova would repeat
Or maybe he had huge distracting personal troubles 	 Or maybe he was sick
It is a fun song that motivates as well 	 I like that
More than excited I 'm ecstatic I 'm ready for the season to start today 	 I 'm really looking forward to seeing Adrian Peterson help out Drew Brees
He used to sing for Hooty and the Blowfish 	 OH yeah That 's where I know that name I remember him in the 's Wonder why he changed genre
What happens next 	 The mNative in the title is Clym Yeobright who 's just returned from years in Paris and she sees him as romantic and capable of rescuing her

And put some miles on it 	 I 'm going to give it to you
What 's that about 	 A fog covers a town and huge inter-dimensional spiders invade
He does get a lot of sacks That 's a bit too situational to justify that pick though 	 I totally agree I thought Sidney Jones was a good pick though
That sounds really cool I 'm going to watch that soon Which movie is your favorite 	 Probably Captain America Civil War
Yeah I definitely miss the matinee pricing that you can get outside of NYC 	 Right I do n't always want to pay for a ticket

And the rest of the cast was great too 	 Leto played a great role

Hes grown some 	 Im glad that bieber fever thing is over though
Who does n't like a monkey they are mischievous and funny 	 That is true my favorite part of the movie is when Carpet keeps playing tricks on Abu and scares him
Wow that 's a really good concept I really liked him in Ender 's Game and Miss Peregrine 's Home For Peculiar Children I also enjoy all of Gary Oldman 's performances Britt Robertson was a friend in this movie 	 Britt Robertson plays his only friend She 's a student on Earth and they communicate via chat daily He eventually makes his way back to Earth and begins his fish out of water experience

Yes there is a lot that goes on in this movie about sea life 	 Thank you for the recommendation
Look at what Cousins did last year with nothing 	 What do you mean nothing Their OL was okay
I think LP has changed is genre from rock to more of a techno 	 Yes their last album of mix of techno and rock

He was more political in his lyrics than Biggie too which I always liked 	 Me too political rap is the best type
It goes against what teams should do 	 I mean are the inmates running things over there

No but they got some sitcom like shows 	 Wow I didnt think it was that big of a flick to start

I was so happy to see a Pembroke Welsh Corgi in it 	 Which dog was that
Love that one too 	 Bret Michaels has a great voice
I would always gets scared she was going to keep Ariel 's voice even though I knew better 	 Ha well she did n't play fair I would get so mad every time I watched it when she would change into a beautiful woman to charm the Prince
Yes Deep Water Horizon 	 I seen it such a drama
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
Pretty much it takes place in the coroners office which gives it a creepy claustrophobic feel The setup is very terrifying and the suspense as they 're trying to figure out Jane 's death is so unnerving 	 Is this more supernatural horror
I 've heard of Bon Iver but not Sufjan Stevens 	 His stuff is amazing 4th of July is probably my favorite song off of Carrie Lowell
Oh sign of the times I LOVE that one 	 Yeah it 's suprisingly good
metallica doesnt need a superstar drummer 	 and lars does all the talking too
I have been listening to a weird mix of music lately 	 From a lot of genres
What 's he like It 's a weird name 	 He 's a super dorky Jewish guy and a lot of his raps are parodies of just that
I am a really big fan of action movies 	 Oh ya me too Have you seen the Rush Hour Series
Was the movie as good as Finding Nemo 	 I think it was even better than that It was funny emotional and clever
Bet Gal Gadot was pretty easy on the eyes too 	 Yep but she is actually a pretty tough woman in real life She used to train with the Israely military
Yeah they drafted a bunch of players around that time that went on to become Hall of Famers 	 I remember they beat the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl
I 'm thinking that we may need to branch out and watch different TV shows 	 Yes I am getting tired of the same songs over and over Another cute one though is Octonauts
Yeah He had a silence that was creepy yet intriguing Who is your favorite 	 I liked Freddy mainly cause he was funny at the same time and deadly
It was so wierd 	 I dont know why they didnt make another one
Not a lot other than some of Simba 's experiences 	 I watched it recently
Janice was gorgeous Marisa Berenson was my favorite from that decade though 	 Wait I change my favorite I forgot about Iman
Plus I just did n't care for the story or setting 	 The look was top notch though
Yeah I actually prefer it more than the first one because I like the romance story between Kiara and Kovu 	 It does seem to be more developed than Simba and Nala 's romance
Probably because he is n't well known and has n't had any time in the NFL 	 I would like to see their offensive line catch up with the talent of their defense
He had some great songs with the Traveling Wilburys too 	 He sure did
I have to say you keep me guessing what is going to come out of that eclectic bean of yours 	 I do n't know why I like some of the things I do at my age I guess it 's because age is just a number It always has been
Such an underrated movie 	 I know And I know it was kind of like Starship Troopers but
Very funny you literalist Anyway I love when the lesser school that 's paid to lose wins 	 Ha that 's right They spent the school 's money to buy a win and did n't get it
Yes I can give credit when its due Tom Brady has won more superbowls 	 Brady also have more passing guards of completion than Rodgers
I could n't believe it So embarrasing 	 Yeah NBA just needs the Finals to happen already
One of my personal favorites the way in which she collaborated with Mac Miller 	 I like that song too my favorite would have to be Dangerous woman
Maybe but the music was very different 	 She used Nicki 's mirror mirror on the wall line
Oh I 've heard that 	 There is a free show on Saturday
Are you a big Dan Fogelberg fan 	 No I do n't believe so What songs did he sing
That 's sad to hear 	 But fortunately the good guys still succeed and accomplish their goal
True I just dont see them thinking thats the direction they want to go in 	 Do you think another expansion team will come into play
Oh then I bet my mom would like his music too 	 Definitely Maybe get her the album Rockin at the Hops
Hey when does the football season start 	 I think it starts September 10th
Or getting decent pitching 	 Thats the most shocking I think
I read one scouting report about how he has some of the best footwork in the nfl 	 It 's hard to make a statement like that before he has even taken a snap but I am excited to see how he compares to some of the better vets
It includes previously unreleased tracks a few B-sides and of course the remastered original 	 That sound pretty neat I did n't realize you were such a fan of Radiohead
Why do you ask 	 I was just trying to figure it out
he really did 	 kanye views him as a protege i think
Yea and the instruments are better 	 To each their own

Merlin 's beard the Prisoner of Azkaban movie was awful 	 Okay I know you hate it but can you name ANYTHING you like about it
I also do n't like that on Sundays there 's only ever two games on at once 	 Yeah they only have deals with the NFL network CBS Fox and NBC
What music do you think is the most powerful 	 Classical
I am neutral about it It can be biased but it makes sense for women to see it with each other 	 I agree completely
I think she is short 	 I think she is foot inch
Dont forget she had the help of her friends Sebastian and Flounder to beat Ursula 	 You 're right They did make quite a team
That is a strange analogy but I kind of understand 	 It 's just dog eat dog out there and the wisest players are the most experienced
That is a good sign that even the critics are giving it good ratings 	 They gave it out of stars
Do you like Lifetime movies 	 No I Think they are all campy
Yeah the songs I 've heard by New Order are really good 	 If I was on a deserted island I would not be upset if all I had to listen to was New Order music
Yes that was an iconic line 	 Yeah pretty funny quote
Probably when he finished the first real suit not the make shift one in the cave 	 Do you like the red color of the suit
It was quite thrilling 	 Oh ok that is a great quality for a movie
I know right they say nothing but make millions of dollars 	 Let me make a song and say nothing to make millions
Might be but the plot was written with him in mind 	 That is exactly the problem
I 've always had a thing for villains and Vader is one of those bad guys that 's not such a bad guy deep down 	 Why do you say he 's not such a bad guy

Yeah she is did you see her in American Horror Story 	 Yes I did I 'd like to go to one of her concerts
Me too I bet it will be great 	 She was amazing in all her performances
Yeah every variety of music offers something a little different 	 Definitely you ca n't listen to the same thing all the time and sometimes you want quieter music instead of louder music
I never actually saw it Did you 	 I did see that movie It was just okay I think I loved it for the actors in it more than the film making quality
Hey did you see this movie about contacting or speaking with aliens It 's quite new 	 Do you mean Arrival
What are some other songs 	 Soon We 'll Be Found The Greatest Alive among a few
Yes he plays a good game 	 Well we will be able to see what both players bring to the field this year
Hello 	 Doing good today
What 's the rating though 	 It 's rated PG-13 so do n't worry about that it 's not THAT nasty
The Giants won three world series on pitching and mediocre offense 	 Yes they are one of the worst teams I 've ever seen to win a World Series
Was the best Not anymore 	 Why do you think brady is better
The Milwaukee bucks are a team on the rise 	 Yeah they have a good coach in Jason Kidd and the Greek Freak is the real deal
A trip might work 	 Well lets start a schedule of it
Me too 	 They are a grest band
Did you know that blonde actor I forget his name did Lightning McQueen 's name 	 You mean Owen Wilson
Well I guess I do n't I would n't even recognize Pitbull 	 But you 'd recognize his sunglasses
Yeah and he falls into the Sarlacc Pit and it belches after it swallows him 	 But of course we ca n't forget Princess Leia and the golden bikini
Name some songs you like 	 Peace be still is a great one
Really do you think Rodgers can win another one 	 Absolutely he 's got the arm their team got better on defense during the offseason
I think the Goo Goo Dolls are comparable to Match Box 	 I agree I also think you can compare them to Third Eye Blind

There was a part with a rhino that was great 	 Yeah in middle school everyone talked about that part
Easy to do it 's been a long time 	 Yeah it 's been some months

Your right and when was the last time the Titans went to the playoffs 	 I do n't know school me
Hey have you seen any good movies lately 	 I saw the new Fast and Furious movie in theaters last week
No way Kendrick Lamar wants to express very relevant topics through his music 	 I heard that the album 's at the top of the Billboard chart
Then what 	 What do you feel like
Nah that would not be good 	 Yes it would
That was a really good one 	 I read the budget was million
One of my favorite movies now I watched it like five times in a row when I bought the dvd 	 Me too almost as many times It was hilarious well acted and so much action packed in
It 's weird how that happens I feel like that is n't usually the case with song parodies 	 I think it 's like that with Weird Al because he 's so out there
personally i 'm going to watching how DeMarco Murray continues to perform 	 I like Tennessee 's quarterback Mariota If he continues to perform that will only make Murray more dangerous
what is there to talk about Queen 	 Freddy Mercury
What other actors are there in the movie 	 Heath Ledger Julia Stiles There is a part where Heath Ledger sings it 's amazing
It sounds like fun 	 Glad to help
Yeah Brady takes pay cuts to keep guys like him around to make the team stronger 	 Smart move with him in there it keeps Tom healthy and he does n't get hit as much
I remember the mom took pains to keep her kids away from all the super powers and adventures 	 But that proved to be fruitless when the family got in trouble
And those bands never had number-one hits on the charts 	 Right although their music is very creative and even sophistocated I think it takes a more seasoned musical taste to appreciate it
Nevermind is an iconic album 	 Did n't they have a third album too
I like that their universe creates roles for each of the characters 	 It is important to maintain harmony within the plot lines
Hey I 'm also headed in the same direction wan na call a tow truck to tow your vehicle and then we head to Atlanta 	 Uhhhh sure yeah
Yes also hoping for some of the young players to emerge 	 I am sure some will take the stage

Maybe 	 Well they need more age appropriate actors
I did n't like the lyrics She sure is pretty though 	 I like when she gets together with other singers like when she sang with Jessie J in Bang Bang
Had a lot of cool special effects 	 Not sure if I ever followed the actual story line
no who did they play 	 The White Sox and they won
I ca n't believe a human is capable of doing some of the stuff he does 	 Definitely one of the players worth watching a game for
Hey I got two tickets to the big game this weekend Wan na go 	 Yeah which teams are playing
How so 	 Like that song Lazy song where he does n't do anything that day boring and whiney
It gives kids a chance to shine 	 It is very important to some towns

I love Disney movies 	 They are my favorite animated movies
Do you like any of the Beatle 's songs 	 Yeah I like the Birthday Song and I wan na hold your hand
That 's why you read the lyrics beforehand my friend 	 I also do n't feel like I could ever sing along to it
I like when he raps very powerfully and quickly towards the ending of a song Such intensity 	 I agree Just be on the lookout for that song You will love it
I like Blank Space and Style 	 I think I 'd choose Love Story and What about Adele
I think they will have to make it to the playoffs to see some kind of jump in attendance 	 Plus it so costly to buy anything there
Me neither actually I think most of the time I hear him featured on one of Kanye 's songs or something 	 You 're right The last song I heard by him was Shining but that was on DJ Khaled 's new album and it featured Beyonc√©
Oh yeah Tell me about it 	 Do you remember when AJ Green of the Bengals did a TD with yards
I 'm sure his show will be awesome 	 I hope so Anything else you listen to lately that you recommend
Oh my Gosh The Passion Of Christ gave me a whole new outlook on Jesus Christ broke my heart 	 Mel Gibson really captured our loving savior 's Story like no other has The scene where Jesus was tortured really compelling
I am a Patriots fan and they 're always good 	 Hmmm last time we were together you were a Bronco 's fan What 's up with that
Perfect illusion made it into the top 	 Million reasons peaked at four
I guess it depends on your definition of highly regarded 	 I suppose so but not sure how anyone could feel he deserves more recognition he gets a pretty large amount as is
Yeah it is pretty Dope 	 Who is it by
I do n't think people realize the greatness that we 're witnessing in his coaching abilities 	 For sure He 'll be talked about for years to come
Hey what do you think about NFL salaries compared to NBA salaries 	 Both are raking in cash but the NFL players are definitely getting the short end of the stick
Their management is terrible and has a history of this sort of thing 	 You think the Rockies can keep it up all year
Which one is that The one with the arcade or whatever 	 Yeah the video is amazing but the song is pretty fun on it 's own
It 's one of my favorite animated movies Do you know what year it came out 	 I 'm not sure but I think it was in the 1950s
The video must have been pretty cool 	 They shot the video in California at a resort it was beautiful it 's a romantic song so it was the perfect place for it
That is a really good song too Robin Williams made a really good genie 	 Yes he was a really good genie My favorite character is Abu
No but I 've rewatched the original recently 	 Did your kids like it
Looks like November 2nd 	 I cant wait
Yes it did seem that way 	 They have also came out with a lot of other good music Down with the sickness was good and they also contributed to the Transformers sound track
Of course And my bum looked great 	 Haha So who is winning
All the time when I was in school 	 The boyband era was something else it makes me laugh now when I hear the music
It was released in 	 Oh so it just came out
And who could forget K2-SO Haha 	 Oh yeah he was the best and really brought up some great dialogue between the main group of rebels
I 'm not sure that simply not having electricity would make a difference 	 It seemed really unsafe to have the trexes behind those flimsy electric fences
I bet thats why their love songs are so meaningful 	 They are another great duet in Country Music
He will only get better He still has the OL to protect 	 Dallas has pretty good RB WR 's
That would have been pretty cool 	 I 'd have some new chill music at least
Cardinals 	 Yeah they are awesome
Yeah but the problem is that word moments A movie should have more than a few of those 	 I guess you 're right Still I have high hopes for Wonder Woman
Have you seen any of The Beatles movies 	 I saw A Hard Day 's Night years ago and enjoyed it
who is starring in 	 Tom Cruise Annabelle Wallis Sofia Boutella Jake Johnson Courtney B. Vance Marwan Kenzari and Russell Crowe
It was kind of funny that they would play Wild Thing when he walked out when he looked like a dork 	 It was I liked Jake Taylor
Honestly i need to set it as my ringtone 	 I can help you if needed
Oh and he considered Kill Bill and as one single film So he can still make more movies after if he makes prequels sequel etc 	 That 's one weird dude you know that
Yeah that was a beautiful song 	 Yes a little softer than their original stuff but it was still amazing

Is that the one where they are on Mars at the end 	 Yeah it is very action packed
Such as 	 Phantom of the Opera my wife and I saw it together and sat in the theater not knowing if the other enjoyed it
Honestly though I do remember meaning to watch it 	 So you did want to watch it
Yes that is the Wu Tang Clan 	 Do the words tell a great story
No who 's that 	 He 's a opera singer from Siberia
I agree That character is annoying 	 Yeah even the voice is I do n't like that stupid voice he does
Yes that was sad But I think she has stayed single pretty much since then 	 I have heard that as well but also know that Drake is in love with her
The steelers will always be tough Timeline always seems to get those guys to play 	 Agreed They got some young guys on defense The guys they had last year just could n't get it done
Sigh You 're always ranting about something with the game you pretend to love 	 I rant because I 'm passionate about it Anyway I hate the Little League World Series
Would you consider alien invasion movies war movies 	 They 're completely different No way man
Who else is in it 	 Emilia Clarke is the Game of Thrones girl and Sam Claflin is the other big star He played in Love Rosie another book-to-movie that is great
What part was your favorite 	 Well my favorite part and the scene I think is funniest are different

Do you like Jennifer Lopez song On The Floor 	 I love all her music she is so great

Jerimiah was a Bullfrog was my favorite 	 Yeah I should know that song by heart we listened to it so much
It was a long march but we had a great time We played our usual standards 	 My favorite that you play is Simple Gifts
You were a Panthers fan prior to that 	 Yes even tho they sucked Soon as i moved they got good
Im not entirely sure but I know that Michael Keaton was cast for the role 	 I think Disney is doing a great job reviving clasic movies
Do you watch action movies 	 Yeah I watch them sometimes
The Birds and Psycho are both great thrillers 	 I will have to see those
Hopefully he will go back to playing like he was when he took us to the Superbowl 	 I think he will I am more concerned with how the defense performed last year
Is it a love story 	 Well sort of but it 's still Hitchcock
Cool any other good movies 	 Well every Tuesday they play a classic film They played E.T. last week
the beatles expanded music 	 they just didnt appeal to me as much

I llike Born this way 	 With what three words does the song Dance in the Dark begin with
Hey there 	 Hello
But Hans was a great character for him 	 He was but the tension he had with Carrie Fisher on screen was odd
Yeah they were kind of cool in the 90s 	 I suppose that 's true but have you heard Daybreaks
That 's incredible 	 I was so lucky to get that piece
Then there was the Icebowl 	 Was that the Thanksgiving game between Dallas and the Eagles
Yeah it was pretty good even without the original music 	 How about Rocky battling cancer
Yeah I do n't think Sproles can handle a full load for the team He is great but needs breaks 	 I just hope our defense comes up big for us I do n't think we did enough to shore up our holes in that secondary
It had Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprico 	 Oh yeah They are both so talented
Yeah They did and its just as good as the first 	 I 'm definitely going to have to set a movie day for me and the kids
But then he broke free 	 Dolly Parton forged his signatures

Yes 	 Why It 's less action but an action movie

Yep it started in the great britain as a jazz label in 1920s 	 Kinda funny how that 's now EMI
I think the Falcons also have a chance though 	 I do n't like Matt Ryan
It depends on the artist and the content 	 Which artists do you like
Me too 	 I liked californication
You have movies that are called thrillers that also incorporate the supernatural like The Shining 	 True I have to admit that I have never really liked supernatural horror movies because I never get scared
Geez was that when that was What was that about 	 That was the war thriller film Iraq War Explosive Ordnance Disposal team who are being targeted by insurgents with booby traps remote control detonations and ambushes

It is I like many different genres but lately I have been on a gangster kick so Godfather comes to mind 	 Ok And the Untouchables or Pulp Fiction
What do you think of Leonardo Pierdomenico 	 Rock star I really liked his Rachmaninov
I like something a little more up-tempo 	 Fair enough When it comes to dancing music I think R. Kelly is top of the heap

He did and all those plastic surgeries too 	 I really loved some of his music though
Yes Is one of my favorites I really liked it 	 Do you know the name of the actor on the movie

It 's a western 	 Oh I love westerns What 's it about
The trailer is so cool The graphics for it are very impressive 	 Every year Disney 's animation team always makes something better and better
They lost both of their QBs then had to start their third string from the Super Bowl year 	 Peyton Manning retired and Brock Osweiler went to the Texans
Not really why 	 I 'm trying to get rid of mine
It 's a shame they stopped after that one Howard did n't work on Rises 	 That explains why that soundtrack was n't as good
I am sure he will be alive in the sequel 	 Did you think it was better than the old one
Welcome to the Jungle was a high energy song 	 That is the most well known
He will really have to play well in order for us to get back to the playoffs in my opinion 	 Our depth has been an issue for quite some time
That 's true Speaking of him did you see Dumber and Dumber To 	 Yes I thought that movie was terrible They should n't have bothered making a sequel
I think that era in Hollywood has passed 	 I just dont think anything captivating has happened in sports to warrant a movie
I saw it It was just okay More of the same but I still like Jack Sparrow 	 i remember the first time seeing Pirates I thought Jack Sparrow was hilarious It got old after awhile Do you like Keanu Reeves
She has a new album coming on June 9th 	 Do you know what it is called

Not really I just love the game and the team You 	 I 've always liked Sabathia

Yes i enjoy their music 	 Me too
My son said it got a on Rotten Tomatoes 	 Wow That 's pretty high
Those young guys finally playing well 	 I agree Correa Springer Altuve
I think we 'll wait until it 's on video 	 That 's a good idea Then you can always turn it off
My boss had one given to her and the whole team got bracelets 	 Evidently you are her minions
Not me Harper sucks 	 What You are probably the only one to ever say that
Yeah and they do n't have Peterson anymore 	 I think Peterson was overrated and they relied on him too much He was a great player but he never really led the team
Guess who I saw in concert last night 	 Who I hope it was one of the greats
Well I grew up reading comic books about superheros so of course I would love the movies 	 Me too How about you ya got a preference between DC and Marvel movies
Personally I did n't dislike him as much as everyone else did That does n't mean I liked him but I do n't really see what all the anger is about 	 What 's some other stuff you liked about the prequels
Same Especially with the music they play 	 My favorite is the song Life is a Highway
Of course not I 'm sure he will be in the Justice League movie 	 Do you want to see Justice League
For sure They have the best record right now and are very good 	 How many games do you think they will win
I know I mean I know her older stuff is still pretty popular but her newer work should get more attention 	 Well it 's not all good
The Circle Of Life was the best song in there 	 It was one of the best it made you feel like anything was possible
Yeah it was funny kind of in a dark comedy way I kind of saw the ending coming but it was still a shock that left me speechless 	 I forgot to mention the rash scene and the intense scratching That was so stomach turning for me too
Hmm Great Song But Mariah Carey could 've sung it better 	 Ah no Beyonce is a legend
It 's called Hardwired to Self-Destruct 	 Just the name sound heavy
Glad to hear that it gives the employees something to do to keep them sane other than worry about their lives 	 It 's actually very slow and meditative
Not many actors can pull that off 	 That is correct most always get a bad role or twoo
You do n't love their songs like Hey Jude and Yellow Submarine 	 Wow those are some very oddly specific songs
Indeed Bet their glad they did n't get their way 	 I 'm sure
I heard about that game The overtime slapshot was incredible 	 Yeah I 've got to get back to work but I 'll catch you at the Bruins game next week
No What 's it about 	 It 's directed by Kevin Smith And it 's insane
Nah it is not all like that 	 What does that mean
I know it was fantastic to watch him 	 What other teams should we look out for
Maybe so It 's definitely disturbing 	 Yeah I think it 's a pretty accurate depiction of addiction though

It really was I remember I was always Posh Spice 	 I was Baby Spice

I think it will either be Atlanta or Carolina 	 I agree but I think the Bucs will be better
What is their to do 	 Think of it
I 've never seen it either 	 Is n't it a musical
One of my favorite movies last year So tell me more about Smashed 	 Well it 's a really good character or rather couple study as the movie has great character growth It 's rooted in its realism Both MEW and Aaron are struggling with the drinking and when one decides to take action and clean up the other feels left out
What about his newer stuff 	 Rap God is a fantastic song
He 's a great athlete 	 A little out of control though he gets a lot of turnovers
The Witch Never heard of it 	 It 's a horror suspense movie I 've been wanting to see it for a while
You can pratically see Robin himself acting rather than a cartoon 	 That 's actually a good point
At one point I did when he was confessing 	 Turns out he was just having a meltdown but he went right back to his old self
What their movies 	 Yeah their movies
Special effects maybe 	 One of the cast members who plays Flo said she thinks there could always be a possibility of a fourth movie as long as people wanted it She said the group of girls love each other and have become like family
What movies should every one watch before they die 	 There are some dramas I think every one needs to see
What happened during the NFL draft in April this year 	 There were some big suprises including some trades up for quarterbacks
Ha nice job 	 Thanks You
From This Moment is a beautiful song 	 I agree my sister used to love it as well
That is what I have heard Who all stars in that one 	 Shelley Duvall and Jack Nicholson are the two main stars
Based on means they can change pretty much whatever they want There 's not a single biopic where the living person who it 's about said Yeah that 's right 	 Why do you think they change it so much
Oh well I guess a rock opera is n't a very standard entry point into a band 's catalogue 	 If I buy a Decemberists album for someone I like I 've usually picked The Crane Wife since I feel like it 's pretty solid and contains songs that show a pretty wide swath of what types of music they like to make But
Most likely to sell more Beatles records 	 I am glad this is settled as I love Paul
Sure we have no real clear picture at RT even with Giacomini on the team as he might yet get hurt again but we do have several young guns to coach up 	 I think Mancz will retain his C position and Martin will compete for the RT job
What makes you say that 	 Well he doesnt need motivation right
I just met a very handsome NFL player 	 Oh yeah where
I love Baby Baby it 's grant at her best What 's your favorite song from the album 	 I prefer the subtlety of Ask Me
WEEKEND It was like taking drugs 	 Remember that scene where the couple is driving past what looked like a 50-car wreck
Yeah me either but I 'm stoked for the new transformer 's movie 	 I did n't know there was a new one
Possibly but there are so many more options 	 If you had the first pick in our fantasy draft who would you take
Another Herrmann Hitchcock score I love is Marnie It 's romantic also but eerie and mysterious since the movie deals with the mystery of why Tippi Hedren is the way she is 	 He did the score to a classic sci fi film The Day the Earth Stood Still
They have a great team this season 	 Coach Davis is such a strong leader
I hope Jordy Nelson has a great year this year 	 I think he will but he has slowed down some
I have no idea why I know what that movie is Safe Haven 	 Yeah Safe haven That sucked
Ha Not even Moranis could have saved that stinker 	 All too true
What is your favorite Disney movie 	 I think Mulan is my favorite
Yeah He was pinnochio voice of reason 	 In the end when he became a real boy I think I cried
Now that one I remember It came out when I was graduating high school 	 Yes it was such a pretty song
I am now too 	 Unfortunately it 's not suppose to be released til
He plays for the Indians now 	 He does
I think the Green Bay Packers will look even better this year They 're going to be healthier and they 've added more weapons 	 I 'm looking forward to it as you know Aaron Rodgers is my favorite current NFL quarterback
Did you used to watch the Disney Channel original movies They usually did one each month 	 I did and most of them were great I wish they would put more out on DVD
A friend told me awhile back 	 Do you have access to a video of it
That reminds me of an artist I like who is similar to these styles Enya 	 I love Enya I know her from the Lord of the Rings movies
It 's very heavy Now they sound more pop 	 Wow I bet I would like it
Not many people sound like that nowadays 	 Yeah Rock is not really popular anymore
I do n't like Matt Ryan 	 Me either but he 's a great QB
Yes those are crazy names 	 I like just the name Gaga
Maybe 	 Yes I 'm pretty sure it was Is it about a war correspondent in Afghanistan
Because despite the poor performance in II and III the set the tone for the later years 	 Give me two reasons why they 're better than the original films I bet you ca n't
Do you like music 	 Yes what are your favorite genres
From a lowly Anakin on the sand planet to all and powerful 	 Yes It showed both his rise and the start of his fall very complex
I do n't He 's about to get paid 	 Yea he is in a big way but I do n't know if he will live up to it
Yeah Did you know that Hugh Laurie is in that movie 	 What Really
Why 	 There are so many Peter Pan movies
No just a piano and a microphone works for her 	 She relates so well to the audience too
why you say that and whats a good tune from them you like 	 man i like all of them i have n't heard one i do n't like
Yeah that one Something about it is just really weird to me 	 I can see that I cant get into it at all
Yeah but I was happy wih our draft 	 Yeah I wa okay with ours for the firt few rounds
Who does n't bro 	 That was a lifechanging moment sealed him as an all time great
I really liked The Yellow Submarine both the album and the movie 	 The artwork on the album cover is colorful too All You Need is Love may be my favorite from that album
How do you like country music 	 I pretty much do n't like it
Oh no we wanted to see it but have n't got along to it 	 It 's great Emma Watson was great
Yeah him and Nicolas Cage had great roles in those films 	 That 's something nice to think about actors who show up in unexpected ways
Him and the new TE they drafted should see plenty of looks based on how they spread the field 	 The passing game seems to be there for the Giants but the running game is still lacking
That doesnt sound promising 	 The movie was so good
Ya I did I just have been listening to that mainly in the recent months 	 OK What are some rock bands that you like
I think Christian Mcaffery is going to be great too 	 I think he can help Cam Newton a lot
No but I heard they are a lot of fun 	 I just love Luke Skywalker
What was your favorite part 	 I liked all of the parts where they were hiding form the lizards
ESPN said that he 's using a machine to do his autographs 	 Well how did they find out this is true
it sure does and kinda sound good to be honest 	 so back to the wizkid video any cameo appearance as i ca n't watch yet until i 'm out of work
Yeah that is why I really wanted to see it 	 I know it is cheaper on DVD but this movie might be better in the theatre
Yeah you can talk about beauty standards and the need to fit those standards in order to find a man 	 How so
He is just so great and cuddly I want my own Baymax 	 But when the brother died I cried so much
Who is your favorite player 	 I like Upton You
Yeah they are very unique 	 They might win it one year
Better than Finding Dory 	 Yes I thought it had a better story
Thanks 	 Do musicians run in you 're family
Yeah I saw the trailers It looks OK 	 OK
They throw in some incidents that may be from this shark but then are n't So nobody believes there 's a huge man eating shark But there is And he 's attacking near the beach where tons of people swim and fish and boat 	 How does he fight this shark if he 's afraid of the water
Sinatra what is that 	 Frank Sinatra
Yeah ca n't go wrong with puppies 	 I did have some adult themes like alcoholism but was worked in a way that kids could see it
and not everybody becomes like them i guess 	 thats what i mean
Thanks so much They 're so cute 	 You 're welcome Let 's do a red dress with some kind of black trim and those buttons
So you thnk the more intensely a composer or songwriter feels the better his work Or hers 	 Yes I do While you think she just has to know her business and then work at it industriously Or he
What do you like about inception 	 I like how it teases that there are several layers to reality
Yeah it was great a lot of action just like the first 	 The first movie was great I will definitely go see the second one
Well as much as I like Emilia Clarke I do n't think the script allowed her to exercise her full acting range 	 Agreed I hope that if they do make another one she gets a second chance as Sarah Connor
Well she is really extremely indie She had signed with an indie record label and they wanted her to do things like lose weight and hide her mid-drift in a video She refused which is one thing I love about her she is a real as her music 	 So they dumped her I take it
No who else is in it 	 Lily James and Kevin Spacey
I like the Chiefs 	 Cool you from around there
Supposedly it is the same one They are giving her scars and stuff 	 Who are the more famous actors joining the cast
Yes I agree However it 's still a great song and seems very vital considering the state of the world right now 	 Yeah I have no doubt the album will be fantastic Did you hear that Radiohead are releasing the 20th Anniversary Edition of OK Computer soon
I am also concerned with why c3po has a red arm 	 We can only hope they will explain both in the next installment
Like Poker face and songs like that 	 Yeah just like that
But we instantly tuned to Sharps once we saw how fine Bernardo was in the movie 	 He was struting around in those tight pants
That 's cool What 's your favorite team 	 I 'm a huge Cowboys fan You
That 's a good one My favorite is Larger Than Life 	 What was your favorite N'SYNC song
Well for starters Tom Brady might be the GOAT 	 You think he is greater than Joe Montana
Is he on a cruise 	 I have no idea
Who was Minnesota 's top receiver for the game 	 The top receiver was Stefon Diggs with receiving yards
Are you from the dark side 	 No but I just like the color
Its rated R. 	 Okay that is great
Far from it 	 Jerry Garcia was a pretty interesting fellow though
I like ja rule 	 He 's good
I like when rap songs are funny 	 Yes there is a lot going on in this song
Almost I had that song stuck in my head for weeks 	 Did you know it was The Rock Dwayne Johnson doing the voice of Maui
Like if you were to ask me my favorite movie soudntrack that 'd be easier 	 Ok then What 's your favorite movie soundtrack
But I mean what do you think of O. Russell as a director 	 Really I think he 's just okay cinematically but as we were saying he draws out really great performances
Eh it 's not really my style 	 Really Why not
I think the Jets made him look bad last year 	 Yeah they really did The Jets made everyone look bad last year
She dresses like a goth toddler Alexander Hamilton wanted to change the world 	 He wanted to be rich and famous Melanie is an artist
The fight scene where he keeps doubling the best was cool too 	 Oh yea that was awesome how he kicked all three of those guys at once
Oh man me too He is so hot Have you seen him in Failure to Launch 	 Yes I did But I 'm not a big fan of Sarah Jessica Parker
I did not know their was a second 	 Yeah a couple years ago it came out
Do you think they will bring harrison ford back 	 no
Yeah Drake has a new song called Passionfruit that I think you would like so I 'll add that one too 	 We should also include some party classics some older songs that everyone will recognize and like
True but I 'm glad he came to my team 	 I heard once that him and Cam did n't get along
They could very well take over LA 	 Well the Raiders filed paperwork to move to LA too can you imagine having NFL teams and AFL team in Los Angeles
No I 've only seen the new ones Is it good 	 It 's in my opinion the best Terminator It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger Edward Furlong Linda Hamilton and Robert Patrick
So do I. The Ballad of Ira Hays is great too 	 That one is sad
I only saw it once but I just rewatched them all 	 The first one seems a little slow compared to the others
Once again the two Ohio teams mess up in the draft 	 Yep do n't know whether to laugh or cry
Sure I do One example is the number of passing yards in the Super Bowl 	 The Rams were in the Super Bowl that year
I 'm just glad that he gets a chance to spend time doing something he loves 	 Yeah it 's great when kids love sports
I think they were pretty accurate and they were very colorful 	 What did you think of the setting
I know they did not do to good last year ended the season 	 Do n't feel so bad my team did bad to
Possibly but I dont know which actor would do it 	 I think they would all get back together
True that To bad she never could find one to stick with for good 	 Nah I do n't think that would have worked out for her If she found one to stick with her then she would never have been able to come up with so many juicy songs
The first movie I ever saw with Johnny Depp in it was What 's Eating Gilbert Grape 	 Oh yes I remember that movie I 've watched it about times
The visual effects were just that revolutionary for the time 	 I disliked how they updated them on some of the newer DVD releases
He went after Gisele died to clear his head and do street racing 	 It did n't say that in the movie
I do n't know 	 I 'll bet he 's quitting That would make the third coach in two years
I saw Star Wars in theaters when it was re-released I fell asleep 	 Okay fine The first one can be a little boring
My uncle was so I decided I would be do 	 I guess you can thank him for that
Not really 	 Well thanks for telling me
Yea they bought that Star Wars franchise 	 Oh wow that probably cost them a ton of money
No not really he was still really good 	 Exactly Last year was as goof of a year for him as any
Who 's your second favorite old school actor 	 I would have to say gene kelly
What 's a good movie that you just dont get 	 Man I just do n't get Titanic
Well the third through the sixth It started to fall apart after that 	 Oh why is that
How offen do you listen to music 	 Everyday
I like but not the older country stuff 	 Those are my favorite songs to run to
Who knows I would say the title makes it a sequel 	 Good point It was basically the same movie with comedy mixed in
The Pirates won It was a great game 	 Did Bryce Harper have any hits
Yeah they had capes and extra accessories 	 Yeah I thought those were so cool when I was kid
Not entirely sure Maybe someone like the Dolphins or something 	 I could see something like that happening
As boring as the new Whitechapel was though it was still far better than the new Suicide Silence 	 Oh man I hated that album
That would be pretty cool to be able to send messages 	 Seems a little outdated
It is quite brilliant The premise is that aliens visit Earth and learning their language changes our perception of time But on a deeper level it is about something else entirely 	 What would you say the deeper level is
Dont it dover Gladys Knight 	 Yes and he did it well
No They did 	 Yup
I think we should watch it soon There are n't too many other movies like it out there 	 I guess you 're right Not many movies have singing fish scenes these days
I consider it their greatest album and ny favorite 	 Are the Beatles the greatest group of all time
OK decent musicians for sure 	 Neil Young Celine Dion
and thats something we should all be able to listen to 	 i agree i think hes a great singer but also a good person
Yes most of her music is really upbeat and catchy 	 I really love her born this way song
Man i think that one king kong movie is awful 	 What one
Who 's your favorite sidekick in The Little Mermaid Flounder or Sebastian 	 I like Flounder because it 's so cute how anxious he is
I ca n't argue with that but he is all they got 	 They added a nice receiver in the Draft Malachi Dupre from LSU
Then your fanbase wo n't scream too loud if you start slashing payroll 	 Yeah that 's a really good point A lot of fans are knowledgeable about how this works
With Osweiler gone from the Texans how do you think Deshawn Watson will fair 	 I think he will be difficult to face Operating that duel threat of the pass and him running He could be the next Wilson
Do you like that one 	 Not a lot but it just happened to be on tv
Which ones 	 Los Bondoleros Fast and Furious Fast Five and Fast and Furious
What else 	 When will we be married Molly That song will stick in my head now
I loved that cover 	 Yes they did an excellent job with it How did you hear about it
Tell me about it I do n't want to call him a one hit wonder 	 But it 's starting to look that way Although there were many good songs on one album
I still think he has two years 	 Not if he keeps throwing bad interceptions
Actually it kind of is This is why playoff defense is always improved 	 The problem is teams with more talent tend to have worse execution during the season so when the playoffs come they seem to turn it up a notch when in reality they are just focused
He was on the voice 	 Yes he was blake sheltons advisor
What a sad scene too bad he could n't Mufasa hahaha 	 Wow you 're a terrible person
He does get hurt a lot 	 My Ravens fan buddy talking smack He said he also lead the league in missed tackles per attempt
I think that song helped his career tremendously 	 Ya he should definitely thank pink

No I never saw it 	 It is a really great movie
What is different about it 	 It 's less poppy and her voice really has a different sound in the song
Jackman was good but I actually found Jake Gyllenhaal 's performance even better 	 Jake Gyllenhaal was more out of his typical role or rather look in this film
Well me and my husband were talking about it so I figured you 'd be a good person to ask 	 Oh haha yeah I do love movies
Oh so instead of wait hold up That 's funny 	 And yeah apparently he was working on a song and everything but it never really came through
I have no idea 	 It is because it is not radio friendly

Yeah they 're all lights out I can see either one of them 	 Yeah Ryan has n't done it year in and year out though
Yeah I agree with you Do you think Disney will have plans for another Pirates of the Caribbean production 	 I have no idea but it would be amazing if they ever announced one I can never get enough of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow
I can not wait to see how in the world he got there 	 You mean the other side of the universe
Me too But I 'm sure whatever he does I 'll like it 	 Me too
Yeah that makes sense That 's probably my favorite genre as well 	 It 's weird I do n't like horror films and it 's not really horror but Silence of the Lambs is one of my favorite movies

Yeah I get a lot of flak but I do like some of it 	 Like who
I do n't like any of her melodies 	 That is hard to believe
That 's not in the movie though I doubt they 're related 	 I guess so Luke Skywalker is n't the only Jedi in the world

The Civil Wars was a duo but unfortunately they broke up 	 That 's too bad

its a lot of peoples favorites 	 revolver is a bit underrated
I wonder how does the story take you in the latest flick 	 Well it sure will be full of humor and life lessons
Blazing Samurai it 's animated but has a great cast with the likes of Samuel L. Jackson AND Michael Cera so still totally worth it Think it comes out sometime in August maybe 	 Ca n't wait
What song is your favorite 	 I like Toxic It always makes me want to dance
Yes he 's still a top quarterback 	 Yes he is
What 's the name of the new song that 's being released 	 Heart of Mine It 's said to be the first single from the album Do n't Play With Love The John L. Nelson Project

He was a singer first actor second Does n't count 	 I feel he was both very much made a bunch of films
Heywood Floyd is supposed to be a propagandist 	 Wow I never knew that But I had a bad feeling about him
Yes 	 Yes they 're fakes

I was n't either I know Leo acted his heart out 	 I have to agree What was that other guys name

She would have also made me look away in the nude scene 	 What a beauty that actress is right
You 're right I used to sing that all the time 	 Me too I enjoyed their music
If you were betting NFL which experts would you follow/listen to 	 I listen to analysts Sports analysts not betting guys Analysts know about injuries and the up-close info on teams That 's where the value is in evaluating a team
I really love him He 's so unique and raps about things with meanings 	 I love how his lyrics are deep and he is just so individualistic
Yeah and most other sports teams have it 	 Also if a player goes to the pro bowl it increases their worth when it comes to signing contracts
Wait wait Tarantino made another movie about Bounty Hunting 	 Yeah but this one is a far cry from Django Unchained
I love it It is so fast paced 	 I like how Harry dies but comes back

Well I just recently watched the Jason Bourne movies does that count 	 Of course that counts Those were great movies
Watching rookie quarterbacks is my favorite part 	 I want to see how Trubisky does with the Bears

Yes I like the lyr.ics to his songs Love to have it on when we travel in the mountains 	 Yes I 've been know to belt out Rocky Mountain High in the car
Really I think Dak and Zeke will have the Sophmore slump 	 Nah Cowboys have a great Offensive Line and the sophmore slump is a myth
There are many people who still keep up hope The Lions seem to be getting their roar back again 	 Well they just hired some new folks to change up their logo and marketing Maybe that will help
It is really deep and you can feel his pain in the song 	 How old is Token
Towards the end they turned around and played a song to the people in back of the stage 	 Right on why

Definitely Attack of the Clones 	 Yeah Anakin was so annoying
Yes it sends such a good message 	 It really does

He has been in the league years 	 That is a long time
I like the Orioles 	 I 'm a fan of the Braves

They seem like they would be 	 Their style is appealing to a lot
Yeah he 's in the series 	 Yeah he plays Snape You might or might not like his character
What 	 Dance music

Tough call The Cubs still have a heck of a team 	 You think the Yankees will stay hot all year and recapture some of that magic
That totally took me by surprise 	 I know I thought for sure he was going to be the only survivor
That 's fair I agree with you on that 	 This way parents can sign up their kids for little league football after the kid knows they can get a concussion
He still performs now 	 Yes he does He 's older but he still sounds great
Hey do you want to try to make it to a game this yeaR 	 Yeah I never been but I 'm down for it
Who 's the greatest frontman of all time 	 By that you mean lead vocalist
I have n't read any of the comics so I do n't have that to go on Why him over Edward Norton 	 Edward did n't really come off as the tech genius who figures out gamma rays he does n't portray enough anger on screen to justify the transformation
Well he is good 	 Yeah i like him compared to most
They were pretty amazing live 	 I have heard of them but they did not seem too good
I really enjoy symphonic music but my favorite kind of music is the music that they use to accompany a movie 	 That 's called a soundtrack is n't it

What do you think of Jethro Tull 	 They are awesome
Yes there were n't computers around to generate things like that so they actually had to create a huge fire I think they had one chance to get the scene right 	 I bet that was really cool on the big screen I really like the scene with Scarlett Melanie India and Mrs. Meade waiting for the men to get back from the camp raid
I was looking forward to it as well I was really exited 	 Did you have a favorite team

I do n't believe so 	 It is written by someone who says they pray for their ex all the time
Truth it 's about the money Not like when Tex Schramm and Landry ran the team 	 Nah still about money just in a different way Stop being so idealistic Remember all the guys that had the team after Schramm sold it
Yeah i heard about it its call 	 Did you hear any of his tracks yet
It would so that they know what we go through and how easy they have it 	 I would never be a teen again but it is still better than being an adult
No the music is melodic propulsive rock music 	 So their music is energetic despite the dark themes
So what do you think of the legacy of Princess Leia as a sci-fi movie character 	 Well I think we tend to forget how novel she was in the first film from

Harden needs to get help from his teammates 	 I think Eric Gordon will come up big for Houston tonight

Do you remember the Strokes 	 Yes they are one of my favorites
Oh that 's so sad But i like movies that are both happy and sad 	 Then you 'd like this movie What other movies do you like
DID YOU STAY FOR THE HOLD CONCERT 	 YES WHAT ABOUT YOU DID YOU STAY ALL THE WAY TO THE END

Awesome I saw it a few nights ago at a drive-in theater 	 I did n't realize there were any of those nearby What did you think of it
I really do n't know either He seems like a pretty cool guy 	 It 's because he is unique and some people ca n't wrap their brains around that
My favorite music by them was their whole Crazy Sexy Cool album 	 Do you still listen to their stuff
Colts fan So you went to Bills stadium as a Colts fan 	 You got it My Dad took me to the game
Nice try at a 3-pointer there Cavs 	 Okay Boston try passing again
They had a lot of hits 	 He had a lot of solo hits too
What about the artists that can afford to be like that 	 They have to adapt just like everyone else
I think it came out in 	 Oh maybe I saw it

Really 	 Would you like to buy it
I do n't know why Bob Barker would agree to that 	 I do n't either but it was funny
What He 's pretty good 	 Yeah but not Dr. Jones caliber
Aw that 's so cute I only wish I knew what the minions were saying 	 Their voices and crazy outfits are what make them so hilarious
Really Why is that 	 The line I 'd love to turn you on was considered a reference to drugs and that did n't go over to well in England
I 'd have to go with T2 Judgment Day I loved everything about that movie 	 Good choice The fact that the very villain from the first movie ends up being the savior was awesome
No it is a horror movie 	 When was it made
That will be so rad Shelby GT Now that is the quintessential American muscle car 	 That 's an icon of its day Big bad and beautiful cubic inches of American power
Or listen to weird musical processing they did on Yellow Submarine that was a brand-new technique at the time too 	 I 'm going to listen to Revolver then listen to Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band afterwards This will be fun
What Dream sequences 	 Yeah This movie is much more comparable to the Road then any horror movie
What do you mean 	 The lighting the editing the dialogue the composition There 's an art to everything in film
Did you see Suicide Squad 	 Yeah it was kind of lame
Has she been in anything else 	 She 's had a career for at least ten years but I did n't recognize any of the parts
That 's for sure 	 There was actually four brothers

I know what you mean 	 His song is my ringtone
What is that 	 I really enjoy songs that are actually just funny

What year did Return of the Jedi come out 	 I think
Yeah I saw them last year with Skrillex I think Skrillex did better 	 Well Skrillex is good too yeah
I agree They either hit well or pitch well They ca n't seem to get it all together 	 Well it was awesome to see Castillo hit homers throughout the game
I agree I could watch that movie over and over it never gets old 	 I like how they are in the nursing home together
Hey 	 Big Star Wars fan
I cry every time I watch it 	 You see how much the clown fish love each other
You should it will provide a few chuckles 	 Cool I 'm always on the lookout for something funny
What do you mean 	 I dealt with Legally Blonde but they made a musical version of to
Yea I saw Fate of The Furious 	 How was it
Really 	 Especially Kiss From a Rose
I thought so as well I just hope this season proves that to be true 	 Having Ndamukong Suh has really bolstered the Dolphins defense
I did like Cloverfield 	 That was good And an interesting American take on the genre
And it 's always really empowering 	 I think that 's what I like the most about her music
Huh when did it come out 	 It was released in
Are n't you a Packers fan 	 Sure am Are n't you
Oh what did you think of it 	 I think the franchise has kind of played out to be honest It was n't super exciting
They go hard on one chorus 	 Sound the Alarm

And some movies have bad pacing 	 How can it be bad
Who are some famous trip hop artists 	 Well the most famous is Massive Attack
What is your favorite one of all time 	 Tough question

You 're right I remember seeing his kids on TV singing 	 They 're a little odd but good singers
Well then yeah for sure lets do it 	 Okay i will have to get things ready

I have a few of his song on my Ipod 	 He song some great song with other artist like Cheryl Lynn
Whos the fastest player in the NFL 	 Darrell Green
Well think how much force you would need to force air thru aa seat stadium 	 I presumed it was done in sections

Agree to disagree 	 Okay
Oh I know exactly what you should watch Sabrina also starring Audrey Hepburn 	 I have heard of that one and have always wanted to watch it I guess it 's a Audrey movie marathon
Yeah the Cowboys should win the NFC East without a doubt 	 I think some other teams that were good the past few years will be going downhill though The Packers and the Saints wo n't make the playoffs
Ha ha ha That 's a pretty self-deprecating title 	 Yes it is I think another great although less heart-on-the-sleeve is Let It Be
So they have short shelf lives 	 It appears to be the answer
no i do n't think so 	 what about the mob
Yes Although Wan uses a jump scare as part of the build-up to the actual scare 	 How is the music in his films
I think she laid the way for other pop stars 	 I think Lady Gaga draws a lot from her
Where are they from 	 California
Hey you never know either way watching football is so fun 	 It is I like the game and the social aspect of watching with friends
Hi 	 Hey
Maybe Luke did n't even know 	 That seems very Un-Star Wars like
They have made amazing action movies did you know another director who had a hand in the movie 	 Yes I heard Quentin tarantino but apparantly he was unacreddited
he was so religious for a while too 	 but then he started doubting again
Because everyone went crazy for the Nolan Batman movies and they 're trying to catch that lightning in a bottle again 	 But that only works because he 's Batman you ca n't just do every superhero movie like that
Good 	 Do you like movies
Only our biggest rival the dirty birds 	 The Atalanta Falcons
Yeah Romo was pissed when Prescott took over but he is a better QB 	 Ezekiel Elliott is a real good back also They are pretty solid overall
You should take me with you next time 	 It 'd definitely be more fun than going alone
I 'm getting married and we do n't know what song to choose as our first dance any suggestions 	 I will always love you by Whitney Houston is a great song for couples especially for weddings

When I hear VHS I get nostalgic 	 Ha ha ha

Disney is definitely good at happy endings 	 Who is your favorite Disney villain
At your house 	 Well invite yourself haha byob

She 's truly a special soul 	 When did her first album come out
It did a good job of combinging the two 	 That makes it all the more fun
Did you hear that Allie X finally released Collxtion II 	 She did Wow it 's been so long
No they did play that one at least but Nothing 's gon na stop us It was one of the reason I wanted to go at all 	 That sucks since it is one of the bigger hits for them but so different from their usual sound
Yea I 'm not a big Colts fan either 	 I 've never been a fan so I 'd love to see the Pats beat them
Then you should be good to go 	 Yep
Seriously Why they 're not very good 	 Sure but I like going to Ford Field it 's one of the best in the NFL
Moana definitely 	 I 'm sure with its popularity it will get one Disney milks that dollar
I need to rewatch it now 	 Same here

Also do n't forget Baby Groot 	 Baby Groot was adorable Maybe my favorite part of the movie
I think that 's why I really loved The World 's End because of how crazy it got after that 	 Edgar Wright is a genius I have to go watch Baby Driver and see how he did with that
Troy Aikman 	 At least he 's still announcing
yes I have The first movie was so scary 	 I totally agree I was not able to sleep for days
It is a great thriller that will keep you guessing 	 I started to watch it a long time ago but something came up

It had a few actors 	 Dee Wallace was in it
That 's true I ca n't think of how they would 've done it with older effects 	 I think that movie was the best out of all the prequel movies
Is n't it about a guy having a really fast car 	 No the song is about how she is escaping an abusive father but lives with an abusive boyfriend

Is Kevin Hart in that movie 	 Yes and the movie is so funny It 's also fast paced so you wo n't get bored
Well I like it 	 Why do you like it
I think that it 's all for show and irrelevant 	 I somewhat agree although I think those players deserve recognition
I suppose we can agree to disagree in a friendly way 	 Of course Despite our favorite being a little different neither of us can disagree on the fact that Star Wars overall is an amazing film series
If we win half our first six games then we are in great shape with a distinctly unfavorable schedule to begin the season 	 Watson has n't even thrown a pass yet
I 'm a little concerned about our secondary 	 I 'm not I think we have vast improvements over last year

Oh yeah But they turn around now 	 Yeah they 've been playing much better Though I still ca n't forget that game where Aaron Rodgers throw that Hail Mary and beat them
In my opinion they 're talking about the way the words and music flow with each other it 's like a groove when you 're in it you 're in it 	 Do you ever get offended by the lyrics Has n't there been controversy with rap lyrics
Nick Cage That guy is a riot He 's so goofy and fun 	 So goofy and awful you mean

Well maybe i should look them up 	 Do so
Yeah I did It gave me hope haha 	 I can see that His life was incredible

Oh I love Pocahontas 	 Yeah she is a really neat character I like the princesses that are n't so damsel in distress
Yeah I just feel like I can t relate to a lot of hip-hop 	 What do you mean

Absolutely agree with you there 	 Do you think he will carry his team to the super bowl

I ca n't tonight let 's go tomorrow 	 I am such a Star Wars fan I want to go see the new Star War 's movie
It was an interesting take on the film for sure 	 In the end I think the prisoner ends up still going crazy does n't he
But it seems like the media really likes their work and they 're very famous now 	 Yeah I supposed it 's alright that they sacrificed a bit of individuality to become more famous
One song I heard was like grunge/metal sort of The other was a parody of Henry the Eighth 	 Herman 's Hermits I like that song
Ok bring your baskeball 	 ok
What 's that 	 It 's generally hula hooping with a song playing Then doing a routine that just comes to mind
Let me know I 'd be interested in going 	 Do you want to head to the record store with me to check it out
Also these teams get alot of hype and publicity to sell tickets 	 I know they really hype some of these players up but when you watch them play its not that good

Hey Ya Ms Jackson are two that were on the radio Do you remember those 	 Yes I know who you are talking about now yes they were pretty good
Alright Justin Timberlake Pop Music Fans 	 Justin Timberlake is also a great Dancer
That is true guess it depends on a lot of factors 	 It does a lot of it depends on if teams can get out to a good start
I guess so it seems like pop and country are getting closer and closer every year 	 You do n't like the crossover Too much of a purist
Probably going to depend on which team is better I just feel bad for San Diego fans 	 Yeah must be horrible to realize that your team is moving away after decades of support

I think I liked Empire Strikes back the most 	 Any particular reason
Emma Watson Dan Stevens Luke Evans Josh Gad and Ian McKellan play in this remake 	 Was the music pretty good
it attacks her 	 what happens
The story is really weak i do n't like that Pocohontas was turned into a love story where she falls in love with John Smith 	 But did n't you like the villan Ratcliffe is very funny
the animation is their movies is beyond the top 	 yes especially as technology keeps advancing how about frozen
Like as an actor 	 He just seems to be all brawn
They should make the child a little girl 	 Yeah that 'd be cool And they could flashback to lessons and memories that he had with Carl
A lot of Stephen King books were made into movies as well 	 Yes I have seen almost every movie that was based on his book
I like that beat and hook so much 	 There is a lot to like about that song
Yeah that was pretty good John Wayne was in The longest day that was the best one it was about D Day 	 As I got older I went to a few movies at the drive in movie I remember seeing Two Lane Blacktop there All the gear heads were there and revving up their engines Ha ha
His voice is tremendous 	 That song gives me good feelings
Hey 	 Whats up
I do n't care if I ever come back 	 Jill good show old boy
Oh yeah they used to play there a lot 	 Yes before all the fancy new stadiums
If anything it always seems like the pre-season and regular season are exact opposites 	 Right what I hate is when someone from my favorite team gets injured during pre-season
Let me guess in 	 Yes
Alright so the casting director realized they had good chemistry big deal 	 See If nothing else there 's a good chance the Death Note film cast will have good chemistry
Yeah his music can be annoying sometimes but I like the old stuff 	 What song
My team -LRB- Carolina Panthers -RRB- wo n't be going with them Predictions are they wo n't even win games this year So much for Cam Newton being one of the best quarterbacks of all times huh 	 Yeah he really has been disappointing since that breakout season in I wonder what happened Too many expectations
Well he did win the Oscars 's for the best score But he 's still an Italian guy 	 You said some italian guy liek he 's not that important
who is you favorite rap artist 	 i love ice cube
Do n't ever say my jam again But I loved that song too 	 I have vivid memories of the music video that was shot in like black and blue and white playing on Disney Channel
yeah that was were i think the whole beef might i sprang from 	 funny though they both do different kind of music weekend rnb and wizkid afro-pop so do n't see why the competition
Wow Now THAT would have been truly great to hear 	 For sure Rihanna has such range
I like the new Daniel Craig ones I like the gritty nature of them 	 Do n't they feel a bit too American Maybe a bit too Jason Bourne
Which is that famous song of Willie Nelson that is used in many movies 	 I think it is Always on my Mind That song is emotional and sweet
Of course Why what 's up 	 Did you see Logan
I would start with Hail to the King and then work back some 	 Some
Hey was n't she on Camp Rock 	 Dude I totally forgot about that
I 'm really hoping to see her on her upcoming Joanne tour 	 I have my tickets and I ca n't wait to go
Does it always work 	 Sometimes but not always
I hated those movies they were the worst 	 I agree
Yes I know he mentions it alot 	 Allentown was about a place he lived in
Do n't even mention their name 	 O.K. I definitely will not say the name of the team that has Tom Brady as its quarterback and that is the team the Steelers must be able to beat
Yeah Edward Norton and Brad Pitt did such a good job in it 	 I think their acting made it such a good twist
I will need to pick it up and watch it 	 You should I think it will keep you interested the whole time
You really think so I will be excited but now too excited like now they are dragging it 	 Dragging it or not I am confident they will make sales Rob Cohen is a good director he will capture the audience
Do you like Beethoven 	 Yeah mostly Beethoven and Bach
had a bunch of hits 	 yeah and jennifer lopez was still singing
No too busy and too expensive Beside i always get stuck behind someone with a beehive hairdo 	 Well let 's rent something There 's a Redbox rental by the Pizza Hut I think they have the new Mummy movie with Tom Cruise
I know right I almost never hear that 	 It was awesome too Only way you ever hear it is on a CD or ipod
I guess I like him more in the older movies 	 Why do you say that
You were probably thinking of the The Cisco Kid TV show with Pancho 	 This sidekick gets thrown out of a Cadillac at the beginning of the movie gets a big laugh
what do you think of them so far this year 	 well they have a winning record but it is still very early in the year
Too true 	 Old man Potter
I liked it when he escaped from the terrorists 	 He was a cool superhero

Ummm yeah that 's a random movie 	 Well it 's one of his finest
All you need is Love 	 Yes They really made some great songs
I guess so 	 I 'd give at least Morning View another chance I think you could really like it

John Goodman thundering down the hallway surrounded by flames shouting I 'll show you the life of the mind 	 Wonder how they did that With the flames I mean

Oh yeah I know that got awful reviews 	 Yes trust me Do n't bother with it
It is They have inductions every year for new artists 	 Cool Who was on the bill last year
The first love is always the true love 	 I know This album is what sold me to his songs
That 's what 's funny The director said maybe the fact he did two things that he cared about that somehow his visability would shine a spotlight that he had n't considered 	 What the heck does that mean
Oh nice I like those guys 	 I did n't really know much about them before
DId they win their last game 	 Yes it was so exciting
Wow do they still perform 	 They do perform but not all together
Oh so will I. 	 I just looked it up There WILL be one
For me it would be R&B 	 I like something a little more up-tempo
What are your thoughts on Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequels 	 Ewan McGregor He 's a good actor but he 's no Alec Guiness
I consider Brittney more like a Iggy Azela or Kesha 	 Yeah and Christina is more like a Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey
I like most of them but You Are is a favorite 	 That song makes me so happy
And heels look so elegant 	 Sometimes fashion hurts That 's just the way it is
you do anything specific 	 I think i can recall one not sure the exact name though
I wanted to go to the theater and just find something to watch 	 Hah you could do that on television for free
Yes it saw a really scary movie would you like to go see it with me 	 Yes I also would like to see the movie Called The Woods
I 'm sure they did but not that many I do n't think I just think that actual facts can be just as interesting as some things they do for dramatic license 	 Maybe I do n't know you liked Titanic did n't you That had a ton of dramatic license
Does he play a Briton 	 No a South African The film does a good job at showing Japanese and British culture 's perspectives towards war
My husband and I watched Maleficent last night 	 I have been wanting to see that movie where did you go to see it
And less of the live action films 	 You ca n't really say that Disney is failing in either area though

Do you like Bryan Johnson 	 Yes he is awesome
Make sure you put down Skid Row too I Remember You is a gorgeous song 	 I will thanks
Do n't you want to know what actually happens 	 Yes but not down to the tiniest detail I want to be able to use my imagination to fill in some stuff Those movies did n't let you The Last Jedi along with good actors -LRB- nobody 's cousin got a job on this one -RRB- had a great story line
That 's a shame Wonder who they 'll cast to replace him in Iron Man 	 Same but as long as it is n't Ben Affleck I think we 'll be good Marvel seems to know what they 're doing so I trust their judgement completely
Yeah I mean that song won a Grammy Best song 	 Wow Awesome So her stuff is pretty good
Do you like the Beattles the best 	 The Beattles are in a class by themselves Of course I like them
Well they have a lot of other good players as well 	 Yeah maybe I just think they were a better team when they had Kurt Warner
If not for that I would arguably take him in the first round as he piles up catches and TD 's 	 Are there any good alternatives
Oh like what movie 	 It was called I am Love crazy deep
Is there anyone in it that I would know 	 The star is Zoey Deutch She played in Vampire Academy a few years ago

I forgot about that 	 I watched it when I was younger it is so funny
Evanston 	 That 's a lot different than the south side

They wrote some great riffs 	 Yeah and people still like their music today
Who was Oliver 	 He was Lacey 's ex-boyfriend from high school
I like Christina 's ballads 	 Yeah and Britney does n't really do ballads
I have the Goo Goo Dolls Third Eye Blind Sister Hazel and many more 	 I vaguely remember Third Eye Blind what did they sing

The mind-blowing part for me was when Princess Leia was featured at the end It was so awesome 	 I agree It set the movie off perfectly
Yep I love the ending too 	 I actually have one too with called The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
Almost no defensive tds last year 	 They had five or six if I recall That 's about average
Unbelievable that they were able to win the Super Bowl without Gronk 	 It 's almost like they 're adding the best tight end in the league as a free agent He missed most of the year last year
It 's true 	 They lacked manpower this season
Comedy movies are great 	 What do you like
What did you think 	 Emma Watson was better than I expected Dan Stevens was great And of course Audra McDonald was amazing
It really is The whole series is really good 	 Who is the main star in the movie
Yeah if we are going to stereotype 	 How 's BLM in comparison to the HCN and CCC of your youth
Yea Aaron Rodger did n't have the greatest of years this past year but he is still a great quarterback 	 Cam Newton is also great but how his team went from a superbowl appearance one year to a losing season the next is beyond me
Right that 's what happens when you do n't read contracts 	 What 's your favorite New Edition song
Not sure What about you 	 I would say T.I.
What was wrong with the other prequels 	 Come on seriously What about the slap stick comedy with Jar Jar and what not
Yeah Do you remember what the announcer said when Montana won the game 	 I do He said Lord take me now I 've seen it all
If you never want to get a date ever again you wear one 	 You 'd be surprised how many cute girls sport those things
That 's a pretty solid choice I 'd go with Wolf of Wall Street 	 Yeah but The Departed won best picture
Especially since having such a great career in the sport 	 Sure between winning MVP and being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame
Probably The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift 	 What do you like about that one
The Falcons were close last year 	 Tell me about it That may be the most heartbreaking loss

I am looking forward to the next film 	 Yeah me too I was really worried that this movie was going to be political
Of course they are legendary 	 Really Would you consider yourself a fan of them
Maybe but you dont committ to it 	 So you think the Cowboys are going to let Elliot go
I know not a lot of people understand this specific genre of horror is considered inspired from the books of HP Lovecraft 	 I try to explain to people what lovecraftian or love craft horror is by telling them it involves demons time and space and just cosmo like elements and they still ca n't get a grasp of it
I thought the previews were really funny 	 The best part is there are a lot more funny scenes than what they show in the trailer
It probably was hard this year in Houston or last year in California but how many people actually want to go Minnesota 	 Thousands Thousands of people will be interested in going to Superbowl no matter what city it is in
The book I thought was hilarious but the movie was so serious 	 Really
Someday 	 Someday Someday soon I hope
Not old Madonna 	 She looks so different now
And if he can get healthy I want to see what Dante Fowler can do 	 Yeah I miss not seeing him rush the passer Sad that he missed his whole first year

Like horror gory or just slasher films 	 No I am talking about Tarantino-esque movies
yeah when he screams 	 yeah he really belts it out
Black and White 	 Someday is Tonight
They have Brandon Tate and they just drafted Zay Jones hopefully they can be productive 	 Who else did the Bills draft this year
THE NEW BATCH was the name of the sequel 	 It was black comedy
I also like how they play smash mouth football 	 They do play that old school style
Well it was years ago It was Tom Laundry 	 Dang you can certainly hold a grudge Why was he fired
Wow Amazing 	 I agree and he has been involved with the NFL for seasons
No I do n't I 'm betting on the Cavaliers 	 Why the Cavaliers They have n't been given a lot of chance by most people

I want Thor to die because as humans we can not relate to him 	 True I never really cared about his character He 's also the weakest actor
I ca n't believe the Orioles Can they get ever possibly get any worse 	 I do n't know how they could get much worse You would think they would be tired of losing
What about that Seahawk game Did they rise to the top when they were up by with minutes left 	 That 's not fair They were ripped off There were so many penalties that were n't called
How did they build that base on Hoth 	 Maybe it was an old empire outpost

Yeah that sounds awesome 	 There is so much history in those stadiums
Which new age movie is the scariest to you 	 I would have to say any of the Saw movies

What was your favorite part of the movie 	 I liked it when he showed Jennifer Lawrence how to space walk
Hannibal was a sad ending as it should be Hannibal meets his end finally 	 Do n't tell me any more I want to watch it
Come over around 	 Tonight
The demolition derby scene was the best part of the movie 	 I agree I could watch that scene over and over
Yeah They have another album titled Chronicle of the Black Sword 	 Ok Elric Do any other Moorcock characters turn up in their songs
I see he thought Snape would abandon his love for more power 	 And not everyone is like that And Voldy never understood love
Yea or how about at the end when he talks to the camera 	 Yea they did the whole Ferris Bueller thing That was so good
Oooooh I get it 	 It 's nothing new to modern times The only thing new is that it takes people to write a song instead of
Actually the best thing to come out of Nirvana was Dave Grohl 	 Oh yeah he was their drummer
Who 's Zeke 	 Ezekiel Elliott
No I guess it is also because I like getting to know the players and cheering for the same ones year after year 	 Yeah but so many of them move from team to team Does n't that bother you
They brought in Ron Howard to do re-shoots and oversee the editing 	 He is pretty good I think he can do it Did n't he work with George Lucas

Sleeping Beauty Hands down That movie is absolutely beautiful And the characters are great 	 Is that the one with the dwarfs

Yes and LeGarrett Blount has pretty good stats 	 Is n't he their star quarterback

I hope the Spurs get Leonard back 	 I do n't think he will be back this year
That 's the one they 're all trapped in this warehouse after a guns deal goes wrong 	 That sounds intense Is it an all out action movie

Seems a lot of movies go overboard 	 Woody and Buzz are classics

Then she came out with diamonds was that before or after either way she did great with that song too 	 You know she was dating Chris Brown and he brutally beat her up and i did not like that violence is not cool

Which ones are your favorites 	 I really like Carry On My Wayward Son

I can see what you mean but the Bee Gees are my favorite I am gon na leave these guys on for this song 	 I do love their greatest hits album I forgot how many good songs they have
You could use her song In My Daughters Eyes for the mother daughter dance 	 Great idea That is such a heartfelt song
Yeah something like that The villian in it was kind of pointless and I just could n't really connect with any of the characters 	 Oh I understand I 'm looking forward to the new Jumanji movie I loved the first one when I was a kid
I hope so He has a lot of receivers around him 	 Well we know what Mariota can do
I could see that he 's a great character especially together with Captain America 	 Now your talking he 's another one of my favorite superheroes the winter soldier was excellent
I understand have you watched In Dreams 	 I do not think so actually Who is in it

I really want to see the Pixies I wonder if they will ever play again 	 I do n't know If they get within miles I 'm there
Why do you think Mace Windu was able to best Darth Sidious in the lightsaber battle in Revenge Of The Sith 	 Well it 's said that Windu was one of the best saber duelists among the jedi and that he utilized his special technique called Vaapad
It turns out the killing was staged and he is not dead 	 What happens next
It reached number on the charts in the US 	 Hmm I dont like it
I used to but this new stuff sucks 	 What about the new rap is bad
It was so cute when the one asked Dory where did she grow up 	 Especially when she went off tangent to tell them what happened when mommies and daddies got together
Yes the Beatles 	 No I have n't
Very valid point 	 Tim Allen and Tom Hanks did a great job
oyeah i know but they were meant to be the icing on the cake for me not the cake itself hahaha 	 you know nicky admitted to have fall in love with rap through lil kim
Gal Gadot right 	 Yes her I believe she was in some of the Fast and Furious movies
I agree but they are n't necessarily gon na win again 	 Yes but they are favorites for a reason Tom Brady is just the ultimate winner
And of course it 's also got one of the greatest diss track of All Time The Bridge Is Over 	 And South Bronx too Two diss tracks Poor MC Shan
Maybe they can write like Lil Wayne does though 	 But not like Eminem he rhymes to fast and can freestyle too
I like them too although I am not a Woody Allen fan 	 Well Diane Keaton appears in both Annie Hall and The Godfather
He 's got a lot for sure 	 How about Close Encounters of the Third Kind
It sure is especially since there are so many great artists in the country genre 	 I would probably have to go with George Strait
I have not been albe to stp listening to this band 	 They are that great
Ha well let 's say any Disney movie 	 Wow this is a lot For some reason Dalmations is really standing out the me
I think it might be called @Fashionforless 	 That sounds interesting Let me go check their account
oh it 's called the Views 	 exactly
That 's a very nice spot to be in 	 More than enough for them to get a first round quarterback and anything else they need next year
Hi there 	 Hey what 's up
Like who 	 Elle Macpherson and Christie Brinkley are two of the more famous ones
Rannulph Junuh he was the narrators childhood idol 	 Oh that 's right I liked the scene where Bagger could sense the movement of the grass by feeling the breeze of the wind

And he never fly coach 	 She shows his body a lot
I know but just try listening to their new album 	 Do you have the album
Well he has shown a consistent level of improvement every year since he was drafted 	 Exactly He is on a very steady upswing and his performance really shows it
What was your favorite Disney movie growing up 	 Oh gosh I loved Bambi
I miss the Barkley days 	 I wish D'antoni would be their coach again
So I seen this movie last night was pretty good 	 Yeah what movie did you see
Yes I love listening to it 	 It 's a great song
While they are difficult to understand their unique sound is so interesting and fun to hear 	 That might be the difference between us I tend to prefer strong lyrics in a song which could explain why I prefer Taylor Swift
Who directed 	 Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg
And a great beat 	 I turn up the radio whenever it comes on
Yep it 's for Remy Ma 	 Oh yeah I heard of their feud Well Nicki killed that song
Forty years 	 That 's a long dry spell but I 'm afraid it does n't end this year because the Cowboys will be there
No 	 Is there someone we can report to
I liked Fly Away from the B side 	 I can think of other classics The first is Free Bird
I know Paul did on Hey Jude 	 What songs does Ringo sing
That 's true Their offensive line does a very poor job of protecting him 	 You 're absolutely right He seems to take more hits than any other quarterback
Ringo who Oh yeah almost forgot about him 	 Hahahaha Everyone seems to forget about Ringo
Yeah I have watched horror movies since I was a kid 	 What are some of your favorites
I think they can grow though 	 Do you think they could ever be a superbowl team
The Atlanta Falcons play in the city of Atlanta at the Georgia Dome 	 Where do the Tennessee Titans play
Its wierd how he takes out a whole neighborhood 	 Yes and you dont win
No But it is up there 	 Are there any better alien movies
Elgar 's cello concerto 	 Who was the soloist
I know what you mean it is almost painful waiting on the regular season during the summer 	 Exactly the pre-season and summer camps are usually disappointing it has no resemblance to the regular season
I still really love Paramore so that sounds awesome 	 You should definitely check out their new album
Peter was smart but did n't always want to do the work 	 He was a nerd
wow that sound interesting 	 it is some of the best music out there you should take a listen
Fair point however the number of good songs of theirs far outweigh the number of bad 	 Do n't get me wrong I love the Beatles I always put on the Revolver album when I need a pump up in the car
It really is and that is why you see the results from them on the field every season 	 I have a good feeling about the Falcons this year I think they might get back to the Superbowl for the second straight year
Only seen Friday in the Friday After Next 	 So what other type of movies do you like
I still think they could have been made better by Dak 	 Well the sophmore year can be the most telling
Hello 	 What are you up to today
Not if Eric Homer is playing He 's a guaranteed all star this year 	 Eric is good but he is n't a Miggy -LRB- Miguel Cabrera -RRB-
Yes I have Some of them were pretty enjoyable but I hated the one that was supposed to be a western 	 I could n't watch that one from beginnning to end It just was n't that funny
No I think he left the team and now plays for another team 	 He was a really good player for them right
it wont man 	 see yah
Do you like Steven Spielberg movies 	 I do I 'm a big fan of thrillers so I like his thrillers the best
I liked it when Mr. Ray was teaching them about migration and Dory kept echoing him 	 It was so cute when the one asked Dory where did she grow up
-LCB- -RCB- 	 -LCB- -RCB-
The Packers 	 They are good
Never seen them 	 They are pretty funny if you ever get a chance to watch them

Yes do you want me to pick you up 	 Yes pick me up at noon we will see a matinee
Yes he is 	 He knows this is a close game
John Williams I feel like I know that name 	 You should Among other things he did the soundtracks for Harry Potter and Jurassic Park
It was a movie starring Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick A dark comedy 	 It does n't ring a bell
The guy definitely deserves to play at that level 	 He is a first ballott hall of famer
So why are you wearing heels then 	 Because they match my kilt
I thought you were a Pats fan 	 Well I also got a second house in the San Francisco area so I 'm a 49ers fan too
Eventually you 'll be right about Brady but I would n't bet on it this year 	 I think the Seahawks have a really good chance to have the best record
That 's a good question I 'm not really sure 	 They also worked together on The Virgin Suicides and Marie Antoinette so at least three times now
He plays a huge role in defense for the Seahawks 	 Yeah I do n't think they would do half as well without him
They really are 	 And shes cute
Really 	 Yeah he did Dazed and Confused and I love that movie
Who else is in it besides Keanu 	 It 's funny but they decided to cast Lawrence Fishburn as one of the gang leaders in the movie With him and Keanu in the same scenes it felt like I was watching another Matrix movie
That explains the crap CGI 	 The script too it was awful
Yes but their later stuff is the best 	 Oh I agree Their studio stuff is the best
Yea she is overdue 	 Maybe sometime this year
I really liked jump street they remade 	 That was really funny
I felt like it was really popular at my house but overall I am not sure how many people got into it 	 Well I know we will have to go and see it
Is there a certain song or type of music that makes you really energetic 	 I think Kpop It always gets me energetic You
This is going to be tough but I think I 'm going to have to go with maybe Marshawn Lynch or Darren Sproles 	 Mashawn Lynch is a complete monster
Yeah it should teach filmmakers today a lot of lessons about not becoming so reliant on CG 	 So the next movie comes out by the end of the year I ca n't wait
Nice I like all those as well 	 Who is your favorite hip hop artist
Did you know that song was actually sung by Donny Osmond 	 Are you serious That 's so funny
Do you have any country ones 	 I sure do who do you like
Yeah it blows chunks 	 Like i would understand if it was something good
What do you mean 	 Well I know many people are born with perfect pitch and are naturally talented
It fills a kind of strange niche 	 What do you mean by that
What a great show we are seeing tonignt at the Met Gala right 	 Yes this is truly a sight to see
Oh did you think he was playing Jesse 	 Yes At first I thought this was the family he left behind for Celine But there was a daughter which was n't the case for Jesse
How are you 	 Doing okay How are you
That song sounds interesting what style is it 	 It 's an Irish song You can probably find it on YouTube
A hired killer goes after mobsters who steal his car and kill his dog 	 What role does Dafoe play
Yeah In high school varsity Saved a few games actually 	 Nice How fast is your fastball
You mean The Voice 	 Yes that 's the one I was so happy when she came on as a judge That woman blows me away every time she sings
Any other songs worth checking out 	 Definitely I also love Commit A Crime
He is so good 	 I agree completely What about Sobotka
They are a rock band from England They are very cool 	 Are there a lot of people in the band
Yeah I can remember all the jingles and lyrics of at least cartoons 	 Same here Not so much with regular shows
I like Eminem 	 How come
I 'm going with four 	 They 're going to destroy the Chiefs They lost Jamaal Charles too
You think so I think he was great in The Matrix 	 Yeah he did a good job there but he 's kind of flat in his other movies
The actual vinyl records 	 Yes I really love the sound and feel of them
I think it 's fun and enjoy the action 	 I think it 's made for idiots I do n't get the appeal
Yes it looked like it was really Grand Moff Tarkin really there and a young Leia 	 Plus that last scene with Darth Vader that made it worth it
Did they throw any away Because that 's kind of interminable 	 Oh they threw away a ton Originally Arwen was supposed to be there fighting alongside the Fellowship They had to edit around that
I love that scene it is so intense 	 I know is it something special
Who do you know likes ringo 	 I know a few people
Yes their duet is called The Fighter 	 Are duets becoming popular in country music
I think it was way ahead of it 's time 	 It sure was
Well they are top heavy but those lines are heavy enough to cause damage 	 I never thought Kessel would win
The new one 	 Yes the one with live actors
Yeah I think you 're right Logan is going to become her father 's prodigy 	 I hope you 're right I dont know if I 'll be able to live myself not knowing what happens
That is a hard question to answer 	 Okay then Which guitarist has the best riffs
As did Blade Runner 	 Exactly like what is reality If a computer can dream is it not concious -LRB- sp -RRB-
I love his flow I also love the way that he samples the speech in the beginning 	 That track is great But I prefer Problems
Yeah that 's all I really know 	 That 's pretty much how I am
They are both fun to watch 	 Yes but I prefer NFL
Francesco actually did a classical-type album as well 	 Did her really Was it good
Do you enjoy movies by Terrence Malick 	 I am not sure I have seen any movies by Terrence Malick
They 're making money hand over fist 	 I think The Force Awakens was the highest grossing film in history
How so 	 I 'm not sure it 's like a lot of actors in musicals seem sappy and corny but Robert Preston who plays the lead role almost seems to be playing his role ironically or in a very self-aware way if that makes sense
Action comedy thrills and romance all in one package 	 I think my favorite film so far for this year is Going in Style
All of those tricks they played on Meredith were hilarious 	 Definitely Which prank did you like most
Philly maybe Washington and the Giants will be the same 	 Nah I think they all made improvements
The original was so much better 	 but its all about feminism
I might have to come over and watch the Cowboys beat the Vikings 	 Oh that will never happen
I think the Cowboys have a good shot to win the NFC championship 	 What about the Greenbay Packers
I understood why it happened but there will be a real hole in the sequels without Harrison 's charisma 	 I did n't like that we only saw Luke Skywalker for a few seconds but I suppose you do n't want to cram too much into the movie
They 're that close I would n't have guessed 	 I know right
And there 's another character who has a great song called Get Out and Stay out which is so powerful and strong 	 So it 's not a bunch of Dolly songs
How about when they started rapping 	 That was awesome
Yes it was so sad The whole cast had a tough time during the incident 	 Is he in the newest movie
What song do you like from them 	 I really like Livin On The Edge
I would have to say my favorite is the electricity ability that Senator Palpatine uses 	 Mine is the sheer power of moving things that Count Dooku has
Exactly its so popular 	 And a lot of players are very talented and regarded as heros
But then come to find out it is not 	 No they want something in the house
I know right 	 It is funny how they have all these prequels now
That album also has Somethin' Bout A Truck on it too 	 Good because I also like that song
How do you feel about the last Beatles album 	 Let it Be was maybe their best
Yeah but you can not always go by that 	 Very true actually
That would be fun Have you every played before 	 No I never have but its my favorite sport
Is that his third year 	 Yes
In da Club is probably the one most people have heard 	 Oh yeah that was from the Get Rich or Die Tryin album right
I think it was both Matt Damon 's idea as well as Ridley 's I do n't think there 's a Matt Damon movie where he does n't display his personality 	 Speaking of Matt Damon what 's your favorite movie of his
I mean a real fan you know from his earlier work 	 Yup Big fan
I hope so for your sake How did they do last year 	 They won one game
Those two have the talent to top the AFC but it also depends on the health of the team and how their meetings during the regular season go 	 I know that Roethlisberger is nearing the end of his career because of health reasons but he is definitely a quarterback who can take Tom Brady
It 's about a mystical desert land and a gunslinger who is chasing an evil sorcerer 	 Whoa sounds like a genre clash You do n't usually get guns and magic in the same movie
That is strange but very true Music is truly magical 	 Yes it is Music makes the world go around i my opinion
I always liked his ship too in The Empire Strikes Back 	 The X-wing fighter remains my favorite ship
okay i 'll be right back let me confirm something 	 alright
Yeah It 's just a lot of clever rapping with very little singing parts 	 At least no one can say he 's selling out
Yeah they could probably do with just 	 How do you staff a team like that
Yeah any closer like the first or second row when mean forking over a lot more cash 	 I hear ya I feel ya I know exactly what you mean
No they cut him obviously 	 Did he sign with anyone
The low budget sci-fi setting was a lot more appealing to me than the more polished Judgement Day 	 I see I thought the first one was a little bit campy
Well I did n't see it I 've seen all of them besides that one 	 You must really be confused by the plot then Do you know that X-Men X2 and X-Men The Last Stand did n't actually happen
Everyone says Sgt. Pepper but I think it 's overrated 	 So which one do you think is best
That depends on what you mean by music lover 	 I mean do you like to listen to music
I liked the movie Awakenings also about mental health issues Robin Williams did a great job and so did Robert DeNiro as the patient 	 Sure the doctor tried a new medication to see if it would help his ward of catatonic patients and one by one they came conscious and were able to move around
I did and that is one of the main reasons they lost the game 	 The Cavs also shut down the Celtics star player
Nah you can know if you want 	 Cool
Probably going to be Giants Pats another rematch 	 That would be great you think the Giants could do it again
Oh loved those Sisters has an uncut version 	 Yep I 'm sure that 's totally appropriate
Who is the main character in The Mummy that just came out 	 I think Tom Cruise but I also believe Russell Crowe is in it
Have you heard Lifted 	 It is by CL
You have to check it out he does it with just a microphone and a repeater 	 Whoa really that sounds awesome
If you have a local team near you you should go 	 We do have a farm team about minutes from here
Marisa Tomei and Christian Slater 	 Are they good together
I would have to say any of the Saw movies 	 Really I thought they were really cheesy and not very good
Yeah it made one of the top lists How did you first hear about it 	 Oh I heard another of his songs on the radio a few weeks back
I love Poker Face 	 It 's a good song but is n't it overrated
They 're both terrific actors and I 'm sure this movie gave them the perfect playground to showcase that talent I really want to see this movie 	 You definitely should It 's a slow burn but the dialogue is so good There 's light hearted moments but things turn dark quickly too
They really are 	 But they are both amazing
I 'm sure new york fans are ashamed 	 I would be
Yeah they did In Medley started up another duo and is still recording 	 Wow that 's hard to believe
Dwayne Johnson Zac Efron Kelly Rohrbach and many more 	 Dwayne Johnson is a funny guy
I always thought as good as Tennessee was to him he should have spent some time there after the colts drafted him 	 I think he would do great as a head coach at UT
Oh yeah You are right What year was the album released 	 I believe it was
Sure 	 You ever heard of bladerunner
You 're right about that They made a genre 	 Do you think one day when Harry Styles is a real rock star One Direction will make a nostalgic comeback
I do n't know though what about Imagine by John lennon 	 Oh man that 's a great one too
Yeah I know who you are talking about Did n't something happen to him 	 Yes it did He suffered what many people thought was a career ending injury in his last game as a college player
Yes it surprised me the reviews 	 The Mummy has some strange looking makeup for the character that plays the Egyptian mummy
Do you think Sam Bradford has what it takes 	 he has been stuck in mediocrity but I think he has had little help
Oh thats not fair they should be able to control themselves over a womens fashion choice 	 I agree
Really 	 Yea it 's gaga but I could never wear it
What kinds of alternative bands or songs bring back memories for you 	 Foo Fighters Evanescence Our Lady Peace Green Day I could go on and on
That was such a good movie Did you like the first Grown Ups movie 	 I did but not as much as I liked the second Adam Sandler is a great actor he 's so funny
I ca n't believe the sultan was making his year old daughter get married 	 A lot of Disney movies are like that though What did you think of the songs
They were big guys but I 'm not sure they practiced that much 	 It would be an interesting job
She kills another dancer nails the performance but dies in the end 	 Sounds cool
I wonder what it will be like eithout paul walker 	 Im thinking its going to be sad
Just buy a ticket 	 I will
Why do you ask 	 I never realized it but he was the guy that sang Against the Wind
Hey 	 Hi
That was so sad that he was in love with Lily Potter but she did n't feel the same 	 God I love these movies
I prefer the prequels myself but i do enjoy the old trilogy aswell 	 The prequels were alright but i thought they kinda focused on the wrong aspects of star wars and the tone wasnt the same
It 's almost sort of like a dark surreal Alice in Wonderland but it 's also its own film 	 That sounds crazy
Are you kidding His voice is amazing 	 Well I feel like the songs they place of his on the radio are catchy but just not that great quality wise
Yeah and it is hilarious I think you would really enjoy it 	 What is it even about Some kind of cat right
yeah that was a bit odd seemed like they might have tried to put too much in one movie as well kind of skimped over jason 's mother 	 yeah that was the cool thing about the first movie a lot of people do n't remember Jason 's mother was the killer not jason
Hello there 	 Doing well
craig owens sounds like a girl 	 his voice is really high
No I did n't like it enough to buy it 	 That 's too bad I ca n't wait to own it
Has she really 	 I think she has She 's always trying to reinvent herself
I think everything happens for a reason so happy it worked out the way it did 	 Yes for sure a force behind everything
I did n't say that How about Comedy 	 -LCB- -RCB-
Who were they again Remind me 	 Ariana Grande was in Hairspray and Carrie Underwood was in The Sound of Music
Yeah 	 What artists do you like
Do you like Taylor Swift 	 Yes I do Her pop music not her country songs
Yeah that is a new one compared to the last one i saw 	 What is the name of the last one you saw
Why do you say that 	 If they do n't go to the playoffs then Kirk Cousins will most likely walk and then it 's basically like they 're starting over again
But that still happens How do these rules prevent that 	 You need to see an interview with Deacon Jones He 'll set you straight
Right The Who lol 	 Good one but I really meant it Love rock music
I need to see it 	 You could have it in trade for food
Those are the ones that stand out 	 They 're no longer reality tv football stars
I like the predictions that the Bills will do well this year 	 I 've always liked them as a team
Do you like Star War movies 	 Yes I love them I have a DVD collection
I would have to say Jim Carrey 	 Haha I love him Especially in the move The Mask
I Dont like the way he comes off 	 Hes really philanthropic as well
Why is that 	 She loves to read and I think that 's important
I guess a team who is struggling with their identity 	 Yeah I presume he wants to show that the manager will be here for awhile
No only the first couple what about you 	 Same here
Do you know how to play basketball 	 A little bit but I do not know all of the rules Do you want to teach me more
Yes she really showed a lot of maturity What are your thoughts on Miley 	 I did n't really care for her as a country artist and I do n't really care for her as a pop artist either I just do n't think she has the best voice
I guess we 'll have to see 	 Do you think Luke will train Rey to be a Jedi
Not really I like to watch movies that are not as informative on my down time 	 When was the last time you went to a movie theater
His album thriller is an all time great 	 That album is just full of hit songs
Well you sound like you think i aint 	 Well i just disagree
Good morning 	 Good morning to you how are you
It is based on reviews 	 Is that great
Yeah it was actually really good 	 I agree I did n't expect it to be good from the trailer
That 's so bleak 	 No it 's also got important messages about accepting people 's differences
Me too 	 The second one was n't bad either
What is that movie you 're watching with Sylvester Stallone and Sandra Bullock 	 Demolition Man another of my guilty pleasures It 's so funny
Like I said anything is possible But in Fantasy football you should be playing the stats at least to some degree 	 I am all in
Cool I like the Wizards 	 Does John Wall play there

I 'll have to look them up 	 Of course I ca n't forget Boyz Men They were amazing
Yes funny guy fights zombies 	 Is it scary and funny
I do not like classical 	 Me either I ca n't stand it
I would think not It 's below fifty percent 	 I 'm sorry to hear that critics did n't like it
It 's just like I could never get into the songs or the music for some reason 	 It never flipped my switch either
I completely agree with that The lyrics to their songs sound like what a year old would write 	 I never saw the big deal about Madonna either Once again a few catchy songs but I would n't pay 100s of dollars to see her in concert
Yeah they wear it down so much by repetition 	 I guess that makes sense
I do Radio One for life 	 For life
I know right 	 Alot of people try and dont get famous on social media
I used to love the Beatles 	 But they were even before our time
Do you have any other recommendations for me 	 Of course I suggest listening to the classic hip hop station on pandora
Hey if you find some reasonable tickets I 'd love to go if that 's okay with you 	 For sure Nothing more fun that going to a NFL game with your friends
No I have n't I have just heard random new songs here and there 	 You should dedicate an hour and a half and listen to it completely

It was n't Jeff Buckley 	 Well no Leonard Cohen wrote and sang it first Jeff Buckley just covered and made it famous
Most games yes Do you do fantasy football 	 I am in leagues this year
Country is absolutely best for her she sings it well 	 I think my favorite song by her was Before He Cheats
True They wrote good songs for both singers too 	 Yeah though I think everyone liked one singer or the other better
See And a lot of the music is like that There 's an office song called Around here which is just like being at work 	 I 'm not sure I want a song to remind me of being at work
I think there was so much value at many defensive positions Seattle wanted to make sure to get their piece 	 Seattle drafted a great player in Malik McDowell and I 'm excited to see how he plays with the Seahawks
I like the new home of the Lions Ford Field is near a lot of other stuff 	 Well hopefully the Lions will make it even better by winning
They play the Jets 	 I 'm going to get tickets to that game
It does seem like many characters get killed in Disney films 	 It is meant to show resiliency in characters I guess
My favorite actor is Benedict Cumberbatch 	 Oh I 've only ever seen him in August Osage County
What do you think of Christian McCaffrey 	 Hopefully he pans out they way everyone expects him too but I feel he is being over-hyped
I 'm not saying they were unbeatable but if the pass threat had been there you would have only heard Kelly 's praises sung 	 Hopefully he gets another chance
I love the part where Yoda is digging through his food 	 There was probably not a lot of good snacks in the swamp
Exactly and then the fans will see their team in disgrace 	 Yeah its a shame to the fans and to the team
Yep he did another sort of funny Sci-fi too 	 What was that
We can find epesodes on Youtube 	 My favorite Beatles song is A Little Help from my Friends which Ringo sings lead on
It was mostly about him his beliefs and how they jarred against Tony 's and how this broke up the team 	 What about Bucky
Have you see Land of the Dead 	 Yeah I liked it but it was a clear step back from the first movies in the Dead series
so many people died though 	 yeah and especially during that vader scene
It has its good points and bad points just like any other place 	 What will you miss the most about your hometown
Because it 's just a movie 	 Even a movie can evoke real life emotions
Yeah I have even seen them on Seasame Street singing with the puppets 	 One of my favorites is when they sang with Dolly Parton
Do you like to every listen to rock music 	 Yeah I have been listening lately to Little Black Backpack
Yes actually I was lucky enough to see him when he was alive 	 That must have been exciting
Oh yea those are good choices What year do you think those came out 	 A long time ago but not too long back that color did n't exist so maybe the early 's
What 's been the best one you 've seen this summer 	 Nothing has really blown my mind but I 'd probably have to go with Guardians of the Galaxy volume
Oh yeah that is a good one Leo is so good in it 	 Yeah he won the Oscar for that role I believe
Not as long as you can move the stride along Just lifting the leg briefly can get your stride going no problem 	 And the stride is when you convert the potential energy into kinetic energy
Well if we are talking about the same movie I changed the station when I saw it That movie is beyond stupid 	 Exactly
Even if you not a Star Wars fan you could still watch this movie and keep up without being too lost 	 Yeah I guess I can relate because when I saw Logan I went with my girlfriend who has never seen an Xmen film
Yeah I doubt they will win it all but I think they will grab a wild card spot 	 I think they will but they will probably lose in the first round
I am I would say I almost study the game 	 That 's great to hear I 'm the exact same way
Get yourself a nice eyelet blouse and let the breezes blow 	 Hmm Maybe a little eyelet around the top or bottom Just to be airy
Dontari Poe and Takkarist McKinley are enough 	 You think that 's enough to beat the Patriots They added a lot more
I 'm not really a big fan of most of Adam Sandler 's movies 	 Which of his movies DO you like
I still don t see why you 're putting them in Superbowl contention 	 Well I said they were my dark horse pick I think they will surprise everyone
I completely agree 	 I watched Central Intelligence last week
I wish they 'd just sell it as a CD 	 That would make things easier
That 's just it though It 's cynical It 's a gamble It 's a product contrived to suit a perceived consumer market I guess most film has been but this is really gratuitous about it Though uh Jedi was clearly the best one anyway 	 What
Oh you are so sweet I love that song 	 Blake Shelton 's got such a great voice
Anthony Edwards was in it also 	 Also Tom Skerritt was in it
Yeah I 'm not even going to have that argument with you 	 Have you not heard Kid A
I have to admit I ca n't think of a single song that 's come out recently 	 In my opinion they 're just old and do n't care
That IS a great song 	 Do you have their newest album
Yup but I get thirsty when they spend a lot of time in the desert Episode and 	 Me too I bet they sell lots of soft drinks during those movies
Absolutely National Treasure is a great thriller as well 	 True I that movie does always get my heart rate up
Plus there are some jump out of your seat moments 	 Right with the raptors in the kitchen
Diego Luna is definitely a good looking guy his accent is fabulous 	 Felicity Jones was awesome as well in that movie
I wished they would have really had more story in to that story line 	 I like the way the Avengers all weave into one another 's stories
To where 	 To the House of blues
Yeah not enough is said for a strong offensive line The quarterback gets all the glory but the offensive line makes it all possible 	 The thing I do n't like about the Colts is their defense Their defense was terrible last year
I think the live concerts he has are pretty good 	 Have you ever been to one of hes concerts
No kidding is Spotify free 	 Yes you just need to download the app from your phone or desktop
John Mayer did for a while 	 Really that does n't seem like the best fit
Really great music I do n't think I have anything bad to say about that movie 	 I know they are making a lot of live action remakes but I just really enjoy their animated movies
The Celtics totally ruled them 	 I know that was a good game
Same here 	 I want to watch it again now
Yeah It 's concealed along the waistband 	 I think I will order a pair when I get home
What team is going to win the Super Bowl this year 	 I think it will be the Patriots
I 'll have to look into it 	 I like them all really
Perhaps I should agree He is old but he is experienced 	 He has a lot of energy for an old guy
He is so lucky that at the end of his career he will be able to say that he has caught passes from both Brady and Rodgers 	 Hopefully he will have won a superbowl with each too
Maybe if Christopher Nolan made another film but he 's the only one who can top it 	 Agreed He is a great superhero film director
What did you think of it 	 It turned out to be a pretty good movie The third act saved it
Well that 's tough man 	 I 'll figure it out before the start of the season
How did that happen 	 They lost at least two games where field goals that should have been made would have won the game for them
Both 	 Great That will be a triple header then
Yes i do too 	 Great
No where do they come from 	 They originally appeared in the stories by the Brothers Grimm
There still is a chance 	 Yeah I guess it is not totally over
So at the beginning of Empire Strikes back you wanted him to hit someone 	 I didnt say he had to be violent
Yes they did They got a great performance from DeGrom 	 Yeah he turned in a quality start just when they needed it
What did they say about complementing the eyes 	 They said it was a very hot thing to do
Oh yeah definitely that movie is hilarious I have to watch that when it 's on tv too 	 That movie really needs to be on Netflix
You have to see it 	 What is it
Yeah man you should definitely check it out 	 hmmm intresting
who is your favorite sith 	 darth maul
Does rap influence you behavoir 	 Sort of it 's wierd i keep it real with who i hang with and talk low about everything and walk with a dirty mouth and limp like i broke a leg Drug 's for life yeaaity yeaity
I like Demon Dayz 	 Yeah that 's a good one too
Roll with the changes is another very upbeat song both on words and in the beat 	 Are there any slwo songs they did that you like
I mean anything at all Does he have say over what 's going on 	 Not really I 'm sure they tell him what they 're doing but since he sold the property he probably lacks some oversight
I actually thought Warcraft was pretty good but only if you 're a Warcraft fan 	 Yeah that was full of fan service for those who like the games
Do you like the snow scene in The Empire Strikes Back 	 Yes I thought the monster was terrifying
Guess what happens on 	 Whats happening
it really is 	 i love rose colored boy too
I have a question about The Empire Strikes back 	 Ok what is it
Whats your favorite song 	 Definitely Kerosene
Yeah it 's like three names long too One of them 's Joanne 	 Really I never would have guessed I suppose that 's why she shortened it
What movie did you take the kids to see last weekend 	 My son was really interested in the Power Rangers Movie
What pop artists would you go see in concert 	 I would go see Mariah and Beyonce as well as Taylor swift
Yes Highway to Hell and TNT 	 What about Thunderstruck and Shoot to Thrill
No before when he went to see his mom then slaughtered the sand people even the young 	 So he was a sith more or less when he made Luke and Leai
I do n't know if they will be able to they are off to a rough start 	 No kidding I am going to a game in the middle of June ca n't wait
Actually he said he wished his book was as good as the movie Why did you bring it up though 	 They 're coming up with a TV show based on the movie
yeah alot of this rap now a days is crap 	 yeah they rap about the same old thing
There is tons of action and Marvel Comics movies are always the way to go 	 Ryan Reynolds is a wonderful actor I heard he did a great job
It depend on which team wins 	 I 'm sure the winning team will be my Titans
Their reasons for loss 	 Precisely
Me too they are one of my favorite Disney Movies 	 I love Mater and the story line is so good Who is your favorite character
I am sure it is that 	 Probably
Yeah it was before they got famous so I did n't really know how cool it was at the time 	 They have kind of faded away lately it seems
Oh was it pretty creepy 	 Yeah kinda
Really I never knew that 	 Yeah you can see her in the music video
Yo wan na get a movie 	 Nah i am bored of movies
How long was it 	 minutes
Wow how did he do that 	 They could not keep him from getting to the basket
Hey I heard a great new band the other night 	 what are they named Where did you see them
So did the Celtics win last night 	 Are you kidding me
Yeah me too And i 've seen three of the newer ones 	 I think i 've only seen two I know the last one was The Force Awakens but i did n't see it
Oh I liked the vacation one 	 Which one
There was a sequel to Trainspotting 	 Yeah it came out fairly recently
Of course he did 	 I do n't want a large Farva I want a GD litercola
That 's true you do tend to get the most die-hard fans in those type of cities 	 It would be funny if they allowed open gambling in the stadium during the Raiders home games
How can that be He died 	 Apparently it 's a bunch of different recording he did over the years
Yes and it was amazing They played for over three hours and sounded so good 	 They 're a lot older these days but still sound great live from what I 've seen
I just never got into it 	 There 's so much that you 're missing out on I recommend you watch at least one of them
Yes but I think their later music was influenced by their trip to India 	 Absolutely Dear Prudence on the White Album was directly inspired by their experience there
Do you think Jazz music could be used in a horror film 	 Yes and some Jazz instrumentals can be very haunting
That 's ok in music transformation is just changing a given set of notes by a rule A set rule 	 An example of which is an inverssion which is what
What about the classic musicals Do you have a favorite 	 The Sound of Music
Sure 	 Awesome
It has to be Fantasies 	 Yea that 's a great one
Yes People went crazy over it 	 Are there any other films
I 'd assume Palpatine faked defeat to help turn Anakin 	 Yeah but Palpatine was n't a skilled lightsaber user He was more powerful with the Force
The Cavs were winning by points at halftime 	 I did n't even watch the second half
I thought that it was very realistic and sent a good message about environmental conservation 	 Do you think that it went over the heads of kids
Cars is out now 	 Have you seen that
He usually has a lot of famous guest performers with him too 	 That 's pretty cool I 'll have to look up some of those performances up then
Yes they made quite the team 	 Did n't the wizard end up being a total scam
Yeah i want something to just enjoy you know what i mean 	 Yeah i get what you mean
They had a rule change 	 Really what was it
This was definitely an underrated film that did n't get much attention 	 It sure did n't get any critical acclaim
That does n't sound too bad 	 It really is n't If you 're willing to give it a chance I recommend you start with Immortal
Oh What do you think is good 	 I like Drake I think everyone likes Drake
Who knows 	 Seriously it is so different than i had thought
You can not cheat to win 	 There is probably other cheating people do
Have you seen the Harry Potter series 	 Yes I have why
I agree I had a chance to listen to our whole album and a lot of the songs on there really fun and made you want to dance 	 I heard Lady Gaga alive on the Howard Stern show She sounded great
It just ruined the whole franchise for me 	 How so
I 'm not a big fan of hip hop 	 I understand but that genre is really changing rapidly
I 've never heard of her but I guess I should check her out if I want to learn anything about folk music 	 I mean she 's not a definitive example or anything but I just enjoy her music
Okay that sounds good 	 What kind of music do you like
The referees do n't penalize flopping 	 What 's that
I think they could use a good closer though 	 I think they have a really good one in triple-A right now
Yes they did in the album was just called 	 Oh okay I know that album has Cupid on it
I mean he was pretty old so it was n't as big of a deal I really like Han and I 'm upset that he died but it made for a good story 	 Yeah it did And how great was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren
He had to be human first 	 Then he saves the day
That 's a good point 	 I also think George Harrison is an extremely underrated songwriter
Always on time is a great song 	 Yes i love listening to it
I think she was a good role model for young people 	 She was always marching to a different beat
Who was he drafted by 	 The 49ers
I think hot August night was one of the best live albums ever put out 	 Oh god yes
I thought his sun glasses were the best 	 Yup I have a pair not too long ago
What kind of movies do you like 	 I do n't really watch many movies to be honest
That 's more or less what it is except rephrase it for me 	 Rephrase it Like it 's a variant of football halfway between Associated Football and American Football
I know he has been off and on all season so far 	 And now he 's given up a couple singles already
I know He was the man back then 	 He just does too much now
It was really good I had no idea Dwayne Johnson sang that well 	 I remember he sang really well in The Mysterious Island
I 'm kind of the opposite I am a die hard NBA fan and sort of follow college basketball 	 Oh okay yeah it 's just hard for me to get super interested in the NBA The season is fairly long and my team is n't very good
I think it will be Deshaun Watson 	 Who do you think is the best RB right now I think Marshawn Lynch
Yes it is so lifelike for most of it 	 Ok I like that
Can you name the three women who were in TLC 	 Left-Eye T-boz and Chili
Me too I thought the light saber fight was great 	 I think my favorite in the franchise is the Empire Strikes Back
I know he is actually very popular but harry stiles 	 How is he underrated
Yup I just wish they did n't send scrubs most of the time I almost feel guilty to the British people 	 Hysterical But yeah There 's that
There are so many good parts in it like I said it really has a lot of subtle humor that makes the movie a true gem 	 Is it humor that anyone will get
Doctor 's office music What does that even mean 	 It 's the music you put on in a waiting room to keep people calm
Such a heartbreaking ending We should have won it 	 Maybe this will be their year
Animated The live action one was a fine remake and Emma Watson was a great choice for Belle but I did n't love her singing 	 I agree with you Disney is really pumping out a lot of live action movies lately The CGI was cool in The Jungle Book I ca n't wait to see what they do with The Lion King
If they do n't it could be his last season with the Redskins and we need him a lot 	 Oh no so this could cost the Redskins a lot of money and a good player
He has n't been on the right team either 	 You think he is now
Did the critics give it good marks 	 They gave it good marks out of
I do n't think so 	 So when did she wear that
ice tee got a new comercial 	 yeah i seen that with geico
And they 're all dead now except one Oh ai-hi o-oh I 'm still alive 	 Classy Point is okay they 're described as grunge but if you start a new grunge band with the ambition of sounding like those other guys there 's something inauthentic about that
Yes I liked that one 	 He was good But the movie was not that great
Sure i can if you want 	 I most definitely want to know your favorites
Yes you and your family would enjoy it you should get it 	 Great I will add that to my list of movies to get Thanks
Yeah I thought it was pretty dissapointing 	 Why
My favorite album was their debut album The Eagles 	 Yea that had some hits on it remember Witchy Woman
I love him in Saving Private Ryan but boy is that a tough one 	 He does n't shy away from the tough roles
I should get the books for them before we watch 	 Thats a great idea who is your favorite character
Hey That 's mean 	 Fine The top was HIS way of holding on He 's in the real world
But if you want any of their stars to autograph your things you will have to go to New York 	 Yeah We drove there two years ago to get jackets signed by Orleans Darkwa
Pretty much 	 Sounds fun
I like some of them 	 Yeah some of them need to provide more safety
Well Holly seems to think something is afoul with the death and decides that he 's going to investigate 	 So the mystery is about how his friend died
That 's a very good point He is this brutal person yet so moral when it matters 	 That 's why he is my favorite
I have not 	 I would definitely recommend Logan You do n't even have to be an x-men fan to watch it although it helps
Yea musician and jailed too 	 I love the song I walk the line
I feel that way about all his videos 	 I am surprised he is not more popular
I think he sang it about his mom I heard something like that a while ago 	 oh wow thats really cute
Have you been listening to them 	 Maybe
How does he do it 	 He uses the force and shoots somwething into the reactor
Yeah and they look scary 	 The Beauty and The Beast live action movie looks terrifying
Lots I 've been listening to Aloe Blacc everyday 	 Is that the guy who wroye Wake me Up
Abu He was a little thief 	 He was a cute monkey I want a monkey
I know a lot of people feel that way but you may not have heard enough of his work to make a fair judgment He 's written a ton of stuff and it does n't all sound like that 	 Okay if you say so
I remember what a great voice he had I love that song called We Will Rock You 	 I loved his voice too and he was so talented Adam Lambert has been touring with Queen recently as the lead singer
He does not really have a lot of hits in the states but his stuff is really good 	 What kind of other stuff does he sing
I guess it would take it back to the old days 	 I wonder if the players like it
but now i think he is just doing it for the money 	 he went broke recently too
Do you like Disturbed at all 	 No their music is to hard for me to listen to
Yes I have seen most of them but not the last season 	 Oh nice are you planning on finishing it
Me too I love the animated one though 	 Beauty and the Beast was always my favorite Disney classic I was wondering how it came out
A hauting in England of a family of and a girl gets possessed by an old spirit that was really the nun demon 	 Sounds like a cool twist anyone familiar
Ummm What 's wizard rock date I ask 	 Have you seen Harry potter Wizard rock is the type of music the band plays at the dance It 's about dwarfes and stuff
I have seen them in concert over times 	 I 've seen then nine times and that is not enough for sure They are so talented
Is Me Before You a lover story 	 Yes and a drama
I used to sing that to my little brother to get him to go to sleep all the time 	 It does have a rather soothing feel to it
Not that I am aware of 	 That was really the golden age of Disney
Yes i do 	 I love her new album joanne
sure what kind 	 I like 's 's even some 's and 's
They did have a great year but you can not put them in front of any other team that won the Superbowl in my opinion 	 I guess we will have to agree to disagree on this one
Yea to each their own 	 I agree who else do you like
There was the Indiana Jones franchise 	 That was excellent And if you mention Harrison Ford you have to mention the Star Wars franchise
Ever see her live 	 No I have n't
Yes those were great Let 's talk about Kendall Jenner 	 Oh yes What is there NOT to talk about She was stunning
Did your parents have records or tapes of them 	 No there was an oldies station in the area where I lived They would play a syndicated Beatles show every week and I would listen to it faithfully
What is the next movie that you plan to go see 	 I will go see Wonder Woman next
Oh Yellow Submarine and Long and Winding Road 	 Oh yea They must have had hundreds of songs over the years
Yeah It is 	 Are there aliens in it
i know the singer had a lot of problems 	 yeah he looks like he would
Do you want to 	 Yes
He got to Championchips there 	 Yes and then the one last year in Cleveland
Every movie does have a moral to the story 	 Yes and Bambi overcomes it
Well that is a great souvenir for people to have 	 Her last show was in London and she said she wanted to play her hometwon last since she did n't know if she would ever tour again
Have you seen the tour schedule yet 	 No but I know you can tell me if they 'll be playing
Wow He will do good on that team 	 I agree
They 're awful 	 Well they are that
That 's complete bull crap Haha 	 No It 's true Even Morgana 's mom 's says it 's true
Hm that 's a good question 	 Please do n't say Fight Club
Why 	 Because Gorillaz is a collaborative band It has an ever-changing group of contributing artists and no particular set-in-stone sound It is meant to be somewhat fluid
That 's the name of the band 	 Yeah The Record Company
What instrumental can I play 	 We need a trumpet player Do you play that
You normally harmonize in thirds based on the circle of fifths yes 	 Um what
It was some famous actor I forget his name but early in his career he was a white rapper who went by Marky Mark Mark Whalberg is his name 	 Would you say that is your favorite war movie
Im alreadry there is a great song too 	 Yes its so emotional
Huh I guess that makes it a real cult classic film then 	 A cult-classic even among cult-classics
Better luck next year guys 	 Yeah The Cavs are unstoppable right now
I like to name them after characters from Disney movies so hopefully they will attract families with kids who will play with them 	 That 's a great idea And it gives you lots of possibilities for names
Yeah I 've heard of them but do n't really enjoy their music 	 One of their members quit as well so not all of them seem to be commited to writing great music
His piano playing is unbelievable 	 I always get amazed at how he was able to write his own music and sing it as well
I recall on Fran Tarkenton 's very last game after years of performing for these people he made a bad play and these fans booed him off the field 	 That 's cold blooded
The switch of pace worked well in the song 	 And I think the vocals were almost too perfect
I think they will make a trade for one by the trade deadline 	 When is that
Girl In My Soup Is that a movie 	 Yes with Peter Sellers and another cute actress named Diana Dors
I have never heard it before What music genre is it 	 It is Country
Definitely I call them the Cheatriots and their coach is Bill Belicheat 	 I love that and could n't agree more Every one of their super bowl wins is tainted in my opinion
Yeah who can forget that 	 And the start of the Bills Super Bowl losing streak
Why do you think they chose that aesthetic for Jigsaw 	 I 've wondered about that I wonder if Jigsaw is male or female I do n't remember if it was disclosed or not
They will be scary with Embiid and Simmonds and whomever they draft 	 If I were them and they get and in the lottery I would trade for the number
Are you a fan of Will Ferrell movies at all 	 I absolutely loves his movies
That should be another win 	 The home for the saints
is ice cube one of the teachers 	 ya he plays a really tough teacher who it turns out is misunderstood and he really has a big heart
I got these from Ross 	 How much did they cost
Then you should see the movie Argo 	 Great I have n't seen that one yet and I heard good reviews What is it about
Yes She is my favorite actress right now in the movies 	 That movie looks really good It comes out this week We should go
Have you seen Brad Pitt 's new Netflix movie 	 The War Machine I have not
Hey hang on I need to go check my chicken Hah i just thought of another silly movie Ghost and Mister Chicken Who played lead 	 Okay I am back Did you get the answer without looking it up
Yeah that was great 	 Did n't he autograph something during a game as well
Really I thought that not only did he give a good acting performance but his direction was very good 	 Agree to disagree However his best performance is without a doubt Training Day
Yea and he makes a year 	 That is almost a half million dollars for playing a game
Prolifically silly considering the fumble they had last year 	 Shut up You know Matt Ryan was on fire last year
Batman versus superman 	 Yeah that one
Oh me too They were pretty raunchy but amazing 	 I ca n't wait for the last in the trilogy to come out next year
People keep saying that every year 	 Yea but you got ta keep the faith alive
They always mess things up 	 Mess things up Like how
Yeah 	 And you know high schoolers They suck at nearly everything
We should have gotten Lattimore 	 My co-worker is a Browns fan And he is hot man
Yeah I remember the group called The Sugar Hill Gang 	 There is a song on the radio called T-shirt that has a cool beat
I really like Hagrid 	 Hah that is cool
It sounds like a deep movie 	 It is that and so much more
I did n't is that what they actually look like 	 Yes if you look at a picture of a jet engine and compare it to anakins podracer they are exactly alike
Any parallels in music or movies for you 	 What do you mean
who played wonder woman 	 Gal Gadot she was great as wonder woman she stole the show towards the end of the movie
Same thing 	 ARE YOU KIDDING ME
Did you hear Sara Brightman 's version of that song 	 No I 've never heard it before Is it any good
I know but I hope it has some substance to it 	 I do n't know about substance but I am sure it is funny
No not really I was hoping for that 	 Eli Manning is quarterback for the Giants Right
He did n't want to be a jedi anymore 	 No remember the trailer where he said the jedi must end
I hope so I 'm partial to the Mannings 	 I think Houston might have a good chance
That poor woman having to deal with seven men 	 I know right It would not be very Maleficent
The White Queen was a great role for her then 	 It was I liked that was completely different than her normal characters
Then he always got in trouble with his boss His line Go ahead make my day was a classic tough guy line used by many afterwards 	 Then he had some comedy/action movies with Every which way but loose Pretty funny with the primate co star Clyde they called him
It does appear that way Are we doomed to repeat these conversations over and over again 	 Not unlike that Groundhog Day movie with the delightful Bill Murray
Ok Do you want to go see Hidden Figures soon 	 Yes how about Saturday
Why 	 Because i want to learn it would be cool
Then who is your favorite team 	 I like the Packers
Not me but he was good to look at 	 It was so tragic I did n't believe it at first
Yes that 's one of his hits Do you remember Band-Aid He was the very first singer 	 I do remember that So was his show your favorite concert
Was it intense Were there moshpits 	 Oh yeah The main thing was that their guitar tone sounded so incredible in person
Have you heard of any of the rappers on that XXL magazine 	 There 's a lot of them in that magazine that 's what it 's about
I 'm not really sure how Han and Chewy carry on conversations but I think they are cute together 	 I 'm so glad that Harrison Ford has lived long enough to continue to play Han Solo in the newer movies
Their sound is so fun the singers voice is slightly high pitched also 	 That can make it sound harmonious
Do you like Rick Springfield 	 Do you mean that old 's singer who did Jesse 's Girl
It is a comedy 	 And also coming-of-age and drama
The team has potential but it 's not the same since all the good players are gone 	 Like who Just name one
That one has a great melody 	 Do you like their older albums
Mmm hmm Kind of new for the era 	 His charisma came through in his music and everything he did
Yeah and Olaf got to experience the summer 	 He did He had that funny song about it earlier
The black robe was perfect 	 What about the horns
Cameron Diaz was also in Shrek I think 	 Yeah she played the voice of Fiona
I heard about that but never saw it it was quite controversial 	 Most of Kubrick 's films were He himself actually banned A Clockwork Orange
of course i do 	 right who doesnt
My eyes were glued to the TV the whole time 	 Favourite part
I may check that out on Hulu 	 There have n't been a lot of new sci fi movies being released at the theatres recently
What do you think about her musical talent though 	 She is actually talented I just ca n't listen to her
What are you listening to Joaquim 	 Oh hey Mario I 'm listening to ELO
All that I 've seen in the previews is Mater and LIghtning I 'd love to see Sarge or Doc or Sally 	 Yeah I wonder is Lightning and Sally ever got married
Does Snoop Dogg still make rap 	 No he is more of an entertainer now

Where was the show 	 At the local baseball stadium
Maybe but Rihanna is always herself so after a while the image is secondary because it never changes so you stop noticing 	 How do you mean
It 's not that they do n't deserve it I 'm just tired of seeing them 	 I have to agree with you there
Yes ive watched all movies 	 Did you like them
So you got a little of both of their styles right 	 I think so what about you what kind of music do you like

The Stones are Top for sure Maybe Top 	 Same for the Beatles Great but not the greatest

Oh no I always sleep in during that time 	 Well next week try to tune in
Who knows I really enjoyed it and I love the video as well 	 Yes he always has some amazing and fun videos
Yes but he 's young He still has time to be redeemed sooner rather than later 	 Kylo is more powerful for sure though
Winds of Change by the Scorpions 	 A post cold-war power ballad by a hair band It captured the emotions of a generation However it came out in
Yeah I agree with you They have to add some shooters 	 Yeah especially since they gave up Kyle Korver
What about the new Beauty and The Beast have you seen that 	 Yeah Emma Watson was phenomenal
Shes such a classic I like her and the newer ones 	 Like Carrie underwood

It is called Traveller It has some awesome songs on it 	 I was thinking about getting it for myself Any songs you think I would like on there
Do you like Aaron Rodgers 	 He is talented and entertaining to watch
The one in the dark knight obviously 	 Wow

Yes he has size 	 I like that he is an all around good player and person
Are you a Lady Gaga fan 	 She has an amazing voice
How so 	 To fully understand the story of The Matrix you have to watch the Animatrix which is a anthology film that provides the backstory
Okay so 	 So when they are retired in the 60s after working in Hollywood or years marketing people started making the calls about what films got made And they saw that kids were driving the box office so they brought in by two young directors to appeal to them
Yeah they added all kinds of stuff that was n't in the book 	 It 's a shame The Hobbit is one of my favorites

Actually neither I own this movie on DVD 	 Wow I have n't really watched a DVD in so long

Have you ever heard of newgrass music 	 I actually have
The Los Angeles Raiders against the Washington Redskins 	 Where was it played
Val Kilmer was in that movie 	 Cruise plays Lieutenant Pete

This is true Rinne is on fire though 	 Well he has the best defense in the league in front of him
That 's true those lines are iconic 	 What did you think of the antagonist
have you seen ti new music video 	 yeah that shit was wack he on some other shit
Maybe they 'll get back together eventualyl 	 Doubt it but a reunion concert in the future would be so cool

He may be an older country star but he is still amazing 	 I really do n't think hes bigger than some of the country stars today though
That sounds interesting Is that a good album to start with 	 I think it is but people usually seem to start with Now You Are One Of Us or God Bless Your Black Heart
Did you hear that album they put out with Lou Reed 	 Yeah I did I was not impressed and really had no clue what they were going for
Aerosmith is not a good band and Pink Floyd did a lot of their best stuff in the 60s 	 Either way there was some good music in the 70s
One small change to make a good movie great 	 I would change Star Wars episode No Jar-jar
Tangled 	 That one was so good
Man what happened to Three Six Mafia 	 They are still around just individually
No I have n't but I have been wanting to How was it 	 It was great I actually watched the new one before the old cartoon one
Werner Herzog made SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE in the '70s which also alluded to the blood-lust It 's equally creepy if not more so because of the later era and its colorized format 	 German expressionism definitely has a dark and dismal tone about it It must be something in the culture
They made it look like it actually happened then kept the actors names pretty quiet for awhile there 	 It 's really crazy to think about movies before the internet really took off
Yeah I know It 's got a great moral too 	 It came out a long time ago did n't it
I guess you are right 	 Do n't forget We Will Rock you too I think those two songs are usually played together
Nicole Scherzinger was the only one that was singing for The Pussycat Dolls 	 Are you serious
The NBA and MLB and other sports organizations have strict rules and guidelines 	 That sounds obvious does n't the NFL have that

Jonathan Taylor Thomas voiced Simba as a cub He was a cute character 	 He was I thought the death scene of Mufasa was so sad though
Yes she has quite a few You should listen to some of her music 	 I think I will I 'm going to visit my grandmother so I 'll ask her about the records when i get there
Is it believable 	 Totally What makes it so cool is you can immerse yourself into their world and the stakes are high
What Why How He is like iconic 	 I think he is overrated
yea they have 	 Great team
I think they are out there its just that none have reached the success or notoriety as John Wick 	 I think Keanu Reeves is a big reason for that he is a huge star and has a lot of fans due to films like The Matrix
I know what you mean What is your favorite movie from him 	 I do not think I could narrow it down to one I love just about all of his films to be honest
Do you like playing classical music 	 I do especially beetoven
It would be really good 	 I wonder if they are thinking about it
I think that this is the film in the trilogy that fans say they liked the least 	 Maybe something about the story
Do you have a favorite album of theirs 	 I feel their self-title from around was very well done and had some great songs
That 's what I 'm saying It should considered the group 's last recorded album 	 But it 's not because the record company messed up
Me too 	 It was so pretty
One was The Sign I loved that one 	 I think I remember it being sung on Full House
Decades 	 Those things never work out
Most likely not because it 's before The season 	 Yeah I think the coaches may be wise not to start their best players yet
Not really i see many who have good work popular 	 But it is not a bad thing in itself
Yes look at all those young males who wore long hair for about a decade because of the Beatles 	 Back to the Beatles drug use how bad was it
I guess it is harder to make what you want unless your alone 	 Pretty much it
For one if it gets updated too much it can get confusing what album one is listening to Why not just release B-sides and alternate mixes 	 I guess that 's true A complete erasure of the previous version does make me feel odd
That 's a shame when good music gets broken up over squabbles with money 	 I read an interview saying that Coldplay splits every song four ways so that they do n't get into arguments about money
He dominated like a super hero 	 Haha ok
THEY NEED TO SIGN BELL AND MAKE HIM HAPPY 	 OPENING NIGHT IS CHIEFS AND PATRIOTS
Thanks but I do n't have her pipes 	 Let me hear your best Lady Gaga singing
I like the polar express what kind of Christmas movies do you like 	 I love all the ones on hallmark
We have the Redbirds here in Memphis I 'll go to there games sometimes 	 Minor leagues are just as good to watch as major leagues
what do you mean 	 well it 's a bunch of different genres and it 's one genre what exactly makes a pop song
Really I would have pegged you more as a Careless Whisper kind of guy 	 In terms of his slower songs I much prefer Father Figure
But a lightsaber could deflect a blaster 	 Yeah but you need Jedi skills do use a lightsaber
I like them also 	 I also like the seahawks
They really do 	 I have seen all of them
So you would n't recommend the other two 	 Not really if you 've seen the first one that 's kind of all you need Zach Galifanakis is just so funny
I sure hope so that 's what we 've always been known for defense They need to play better in the secondary though 	 They do but I think Tony Jefferson was a big signing
Well last year they had a rookie quarterback and although he started off good he faded late 	 You think he 's going to improve enough to really help the team
What was it about 	 The town had vampires zombies werewolves and regular people all living in harmony
His songs do n't get old 	 I listen to some of his albums on repeat pretty often
I was thinking either Princess Leia or Padamei 	 Man that 's a tough choice I think I might be leaning more towards Padamei
It 's still too early to tell Obviously the Pats are favorites to win it all 	 I put money down on the Bengals Vegas is giving them 66-to-1 odds to win it
When I was little I had an aunt who lived in Colorado and she sent me a Broncos shirt as a birthday present I did n't know it was a football team but I liked the little horsie 	 Really That 's why you like the team Because of a shirt when you were little
I like a lot of different music I do not like to listen to the same type over and over 	 Yes that can get old real fast I also like to mix it up as well
I am not sure if I would like them I am not a fan of bluegrass and gospel music 	 They are n't gospel by any means Have you ever heard that song O brother where art thou
Chris adler he is a drum machine 	 Oh yeah he is a beast on the drums
Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie 	 Not yet is it any good
And why does that make you more of a fan 	 Because I feel like a lot of pop artists now days are n't actually writing their own music in any way

But then you could easily here some hip/hop and Pop and not have to change the station 	 I need to look into that Satellite radio so I can just listen to 's or 's tunes

Yes it was originally written as a tribute for Marilyn Monroe and later he sang it again for Princess Diana 	 Did he write any other songs as tributes

Andy Dufrane is such a lovable character 	 You ca n't help but root for him in the movie
Set in olden times 	 Yes Like the Prestige
Yup 	 You do n't need to run the ball with him at all
I have n't even seen that 	 It 's not that good
I ca n't wait to see it 	 Me to I will watch every game
How would you describe there sound 	 It depends on what period of their career you are talking about The early period with albums like Return of The Space Cowboy almost had a Stevie Wonder feel to it
Well he goes with his friend to the airport to pick up his girlfriend and a Gang kidnaps her 	 Oh no then what

if thats what you mean then my answer is simple 	 okay
Yes the casino did n't like that they were winning so much and thought they were cheating I think they put them out accusing them of card counting which I guess is illegal 	 Not before Rainman won enough money for his brother to pay off his big debts and they made their getaway I love it when the small guy wins
Why 's that 	 The readers got older By the time they got to the end they 'd been at Hogwarts six years I think
God rest her soul but I am hoping to see JJ Abrams and Disney incorporate Princess Leia into the Last Jedi 	 I think many of her fans are hoping and praying for that as well
Not yet but from what I hear it 's even better than the first one 	 That 's gon na be hard to top but then again it is Disney
I liked Hermione in this one 	 Why is that
I am going to go do that right now 	 There may be a version with some back ground music

Yes and they have one of the hardest rivals in all of baseball They have to play the NY Yankees and even if the Yankees record sucks they will always play the Orioles hard 	 Pretty crazy how baseball teams have rivals that always play each other hard
Hopefully whoever they choose does a good job 	 Yeah I 'd love to see them have a good season
I think crying in the chapel 	 i like farther along
Pats are a joke 	 Nah they are invincible
It makes you wonder if the guy made the right choice 	 He obviously did n't That 's the crux of the moral dilemma

Yeah I love when she sings the Phantom of the Opera song 	 Me too
Wow that 's funny To think of those oldies but goodies 	 Yes and some channels still run them on weekends
Why is that 	 Think about it One guy designs a flaw so large and NO ONE notices

Who is in it 	 Marisa Tomei and Christian Slater
Do you think they would ever fold 	 No the team is too established to let that happen
what is the force 	 the iving life force in all objests and things
I thought that the young actors did a fine job though 	 I agree Felicity Jones is a great up and coming actress
That 's true and that 's why I like Apple because you can get everything 	 Everything imaginable
It was not horrible but it was such a letdown 	 I mean i guess it could be considered a let down
And deadly 	 Yeah but before you died you 'd get to fight a dinosaur And at least attempt to save a princess
I had a mutt that looked like Tramp when I was a kid We called him Scoundrel almost the same meaning 	 I liked Lady because of her curly haired ears and big eyes I think she was based off of some kind of spaniel
Why 	 I like the magical sword fight
I never thought of it that way I just thought they were screaming and saying crazy stuff 	 It sounds that way to us but younger people are in love with these new rappers
It is entirely filmed in a stopped elevator 	 Wow that sounds creepy
Well That 's the funniest thing At every shop or market or even in the hotel lobby where I was staying there was always American artists playing on the radio 	 That is really odd Did they play any french music

Another gem for sure Most viewed video ever apparently on Youtube 	 And do you remember Harlem Shake

I like the part when Ariel loses her voice and is just do happy to be with her loved one 	 Yes and then they go on that date

It sounds like a really sad song 	 I guess you could call it sad I would personally say it was not so much sad for me it just had a lot of deep meaning

Oh really I saw it last week 	 I love it What 'd you think about it
Hmm 	 And do n't say the Browns to be a troll
do you know death grips 	 that experimental hip hop group
Anything else 	 And when they become well-known players they hopefully feel some loyalty to the Knicks

That accent The way he fights the way he always is one step ahead of Dom and his team 	 Even when he is put in maximum security he is still one step ahead of Hobbs
When the second one finished he went back in the ground then suddenly they both came up together 	 Quite the buildup
So it was really good then 	 Oh I loved it but then again I like anything that has to do with Japanese culture
I know that 's what he says but he and Brady have been together for years now Do n't you think it 's a little different with him 	 I would assume so but you never know with Bill He 's very much a business not personal kind of guy
Darth Vader no contest 	 I can probably guess why but tell me anyway

Wow that 's crazy So do you like a lot of Outkast 's music 	 Yes their ATLiens is the best out of all of them if you ask me
I also think that because of that is why Arnold slowed down his acting career 	 That makes sense I 'd be pretty discouraged if I were him
Yikes He 's one sack and one bad injury away from retirement then 	 A lot of teams have no hope from the beginning this season because they do n't have a quarterback
What is one of your favorite scenes 	 I love when the FBI Agent Sara Ashburn -LRB- Bullock -RRB- goes to Mullins house with her and they are having a family dinner

I know And he looks a litte extra creepy 	 I 'm really looking forward to it
Do you like movies 	 Yes they 're great
Then they have Tampa Pittsburgh and Green Bay 	 Wow they could start
Yeah I heard that too 	 What did you think
Why does that bug you Seems like it 's a happy ending 	 Because it takes a beautiful piece of music that 's supposed to be sad and ruins it at the very last second
Yea I know In fact I have to start my registration before the week is up 	 Good idea better sooner then later
I ca n't believe there is no category for that yet 	 Time and time again he 's proven that it 's an art in it of itself

Do you like old Disney movies better than the new ones 	 I like the new ones because of the graphics
oh ok and what makes you say so 	 well the trailer so deep and filled with action
It just seems like every classic Disney movie has a really scary part that my son wo n't watch 	 Yeah either someone 's parent dies like Bambi or there 's a really scary monster like in Sleeping Beauty
Looking back it did n't take long for him to lose that innocence either By Episode II he was already showing his dark side 	 Definitely You can already see the Darth Vader in him by that point

I 'd tend to agree 	 Anyhow Hon Solo is dead
Same with Eminem he is a pretty unique rapper 	 What is you 're favorite Eminem song
I mean when Anakin Skywalker came around there were hundreds of Jedi 's and two Sith When he became Darth Vadar all of the Jedi were massacred 	 There were two Jedis left Yoda and Obi Wan so it was balanced then instead of there being hundreds of good guys and only two bad guys their numbers were evened out

Oh yeah He was awesome when he played for the 49er 	 Yeah they had a great team back then

Yeah but does a good job of showing all her challenges in between 	 Does she marry Cooper
Is he teetering on Oden status 	 Hes shown hes better than Oden
It 's true that they were not as good as in years previous but Earl Thomas was injured and should be back stronger than ever this season 	 I think they will also benefit from Richard Sherman not being traded in the long run
Is n't that the one with David Bowie 	 Yes it 's one of my favorites
Of course I suggest listening to the classic hip hop station on pandora 	 You think that will be like this

Right And Prometheus was great that was the prequel for the Alien franchise 	 Yeah that 's a great example They trashed that one but I absolutely love it

That is awesome Do you know where they are sitting 	 I think they are in the second row

they have been around since music started 	 for sure that 's why they are so good
They do such a good job 	 Another good one I will wait

Hey girl what 's going on 	 Marvin Gaye ha ha see what I did there
Oh I was just thinking about the film and trying to figure out that actually happened in the book 	 I 'm almost certain it did n't I think they even invented that character because there are very few female characters in Tolkien 's work

My favorite is something 's burnin 	 Oh I love that too
hopefully he stays around and makes more grown films 	 yeah i didnt care for his kiddy movies
Yeah Heath Ledger definitely deserved the Oscar for his performance especially considering he was robbed for Brokeback Mountain 	 You do n't think that Phillip Seymour Hoffman deserved it that year for Capote
But amazingly that 's not a movie he won an Oscar for 	 Which goes to show that the Academy gets it wrong sometimes
What is a song that you really like but you think is too long 	 I 'd have to say anything by Pink Floyd

Really Did n't know that 	 They went to see the same guru the Beetles did in India
Their new album that came out last year Hardwired to Self-Destruct 	 No I pretty much only listen to their older music In my mind they stopped making music after
Yeah they deserved it though He 's a real good hero type Like in Olympus has fallen and gladiator 	 Yeah those are cool movies also
It was actually a much better ending than the original but guess they deemed it to extreme for audiences 	 It actually sounds like a much more fitting ending
Not Tom Brady 	 Brady is great but I think he benefits greatly from scheme and overall talent around him
But the themes of the song were trite 	 I wouldnt say that it was a political track
Oh man Bill Murray was great in that 	 So was Scarlett Johanson
New England again 	 Oh yeah now I remember I was thinking Broncos

Who is your favorite member of U2 	 I know Bono gets lots of attention for his charity work but the band would not be U2 without The Edge 's guitar mastery
I know Hudson was aweswome Game over man game over 	 And Paul Reiser was perfect as the slimy Carter Burke
Anyone paying attention knows it 's the Cowboys 	 The Cowboys Really Are n't they all rookies
No It also has behind the scenes stories and conversations as well as live performance and versions done in studio that were not done on tour 	 Wow so it 's going to be a pretty special movie for the fans
Yes of course 	 They do things like wear a gray suit and match their button up shirt and shoes perfectly The shoe color is a conversation starter but it does n't make them stand out in a bad way
She was great in Silver Linings Playbook It was like it was written for her 	 Is it a funny movie I do n't like sad movies

Ha I 'll prove you wrong 	 Fine there might be a guy on a ukelele too
We really should Hard Rock Stadium is pretty easy to get to from here 	 To be honest though I would only go depending on who they 're playing
Is it a singe movie or based on a series 	 Their is more than one movie but they can be watched stand alone
Oh that 's a tough one I guess I 'd have to say The Lion King 	 Really I would have thought you 'd be more of a Disney princess fan
Are you serious 	 Yes
Yep they are But they can still rock on In fact fairly soon after my husband and I went to see them one of the lead singers Cory Wells passed away That was in Sad 	 That 's too bad Do you think they 'll stop touring

I always tease my sister about this part of The Lord of the Rings Two Towers 	 Which part
Of course they 're one of the most defining bands of this century I think I do n't think they 've put out anything good since In Rainbows though 	 Uh are you serious A Moon Shaped Pool was fantastic it came out last year and Amnesiac is criminally underrated
I would recommend watching The Ring 	 I 've already seen that one It was terrifying
Now that would boost ratings 	 It definitely would but ESPN might not have the money
It is It 's a great movie 	 I 'll have to watch it some time
Its so universal 	 Everyone loves music

I know Heath Ledger had a fantastic performance 	 What is your favorite film that he is in
What 's your favorite Disney movie 	 Monster 's Inc.

Yeah Gary Anderson happened 	 The dude was perfect all year and missed the biggest kick in Vikings history
what is the best rap album of all time 	 I think it 's dr dre 's the chronic

But still some time on the clock 	 Yes with a Russell Wilson getting hot
I do n't have much money 	 Do n't worry Stacy just got paid She got us

That 's cool 	 I used to listen to him since I am a kid
I like that they 're starting to come up with some more original ideas for these movies now Keeps the genre fresh 	 You 've got that right I 'm a big fan of new things and switching it up
